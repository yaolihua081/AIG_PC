Before synthetic dyes were developed, the indigo plant was responsible for supplying the world's textile industry with a deep, rich blue color. The indigo plant is native to several areas of the world, including southern and eastern Africa, tropical America, and Asia, but it was in India that the industry truly flourished. The British established commercial cultivation of indigo in the 18th century, using the dye for military and hospital uniforms, as well as for working class garments. This lasted until the early 20th century, when the use of synthetic alternatives caused the industry to collapse. Today, however, health and pollution concerns have resulted in an increasing demand for natural dyes, and we may see the indigo industry succeed again.

According to the passage, the natural indigo industry

A.	once supplied fabric for British military uniforms.
B.	currently depends primarily on plants from Africa.
C.	is now the sole provider of blue-colored dye for jeans.
D.	may be revitalized due to health issues with synthetic dyes.

These are names from different parts of the world for a giant ape-like specimen sought by cryptozoologists, who hope to find and study such unknown creatures. Claims about the existence of a giant ape-like creature that inhabits remote mountainous regions have provoked controversy, due to a lack of scientifically-accepted evidence. However, there is a long history of sightings from hikers in the Pacific Northwest of a Bigfoot type of creature or its footprints, and the traditions of many Native American tribes feature giant apes. Cryptozoologists argue that perhaps, like the Central African mountain gorilla that was discovered in 1903 and has been studied by primatologists, it's just a matter of time before proof of Bigfoot silences the skeptics.

According to the passage, the people most likely to believe in a Yeti or a Yeren are

If your child suffers from allergies, then it is useful to examine the place in your home where your child spends a majority of time – the bedroom! To ensure a bed is protected from dust mites, the most important priority is to remove all bedding and wash it in hot water. Next, use plastic allergy-proof covers for all components of the bed to seal out pests. Keep stuffed animals off the rugs, and preferably avoid these toys all together. Eliminate curtains, or, if that's not possible, make sure to clean them frequently. Finally, to keep the air in the entire room clean, consider using a high efficiency particulate air filter. Taken together, these steps will help you keep your child's bedroom allergen-free.

According to the passage, a child who suffers from indoor dust mite allergies

A.	should not be encouraged to play with stuffed animals.
B.	will benefit from all-cotton mattress and pillow covers.
C.	must be diagnosed to identify the offending allergens.

It is uncertain just when the island was first inhabited, and there is much debate about how the statues, averaging about 13 feet tall and 14 tons, were transported to ceremonial sites across the island. Some archaeologists suspect the statues were laid on sleds and hauled with ropes; others think they were placed on small logs and rolled. It may be that the statues represent the spirits of important islander ancestors, due to their stylized nature, rather than likenesses of actual individuals. First seen by Europeans in 1722, the statues have captured the imagination of all who encounter them. Since there are no written records, however, we may never know all their secrets.

Sled dogs, an extreme example of stamina, compete in an Alaskan race covering over 1,100 miles in about two weeks at below-freezing temperatures. Cats, however, tend to conserve their energy for quick bursts of speed. Both dogs and cats perceive scents that people cannot. A person has only about 5 million receptors to detect scent, while a large dog has up to 300 million and a cat up to 80 million. Dogs and cats are also sensitive to sounds that people cannot hear. A person's ability to perceive sound tops out at frequencies of about 23,000 hertz, while dogs can hear up to about 45,000 hertz and cats up to 64,000 hertz. Finally, dogs, with their larger brains, can be taught to recognize about 165 words, compared to cats, which can learn about 35 words.

Cars at that time were luxury items, and low-speed electric vehicles were satisfactory for short distances. However, with the onset of mass-produced gas-powered cars, the expansion of roads, and the drop in gas prices in the early decades of the 1900s, electric cars could no longer compete; and in the 1930s production of them was halted. When in 1973 some oil-producing nations reduced exports, limiting available fuel, there followed a renewed interest in producing alternative-fueled cars. Such cars were valued both for their economy and their reduced environmental impact. Today, fuel-economy regulations in the U.S. and worldwide as well as progress in the development of cheaper, stronger batteries have sparked an even greater interest in all-electric cars.

Shintoism was founded on myths and legends emanating from the early animistic worship of natural phenomena. Since Shintoism was unconcerned with problems of afterlife that dominate Buddhist thought, and since Buddhism easily accommodated itself to Shintoism, the two religions have comfortably coexisted ever since Buddhism was brought to Japan by Korea in the 6th century. Today, many Japanese are adherents of both faiths. Many marriages and celebrations are held in Shinto shrines, and children are taken there after birth and on certain anniversaries. Numerous festivals are held throughout the year in Shinto shrines. Most funerals are conducted by Buddhist priests, and many Japanese visit family graves and Buddhist temples to pay respects to ancestors. The Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and passing are special annual events.

The earliest documented case is Otzi, entombed in a glacier in Europe some 5,200 years ago, who sported markings at the sites of various joints, suggesting that the tattoos may have been used to manage chronic pain. Several female Egyptian mummies dating to about 2,000 BC had a pattern of tattoos that may have been created for protection during pregnancy or childbirth. Among the ancient Greeks and Romans, tattoos were used to designate those belonging to religious sects, as well as slaves and criminals. The tattooed remains of a 1,600-year-old female mummy, perhaps a ruler, have been found in Peru; and historic records note that Japanese men were using tattoos for decorative purposes as early as 297 AD.

As our muscles relax, we may experience a sensation of falling and suddenly jerk awake. Stage two is such a light sleep that, if woken, we may not realize we were sleeping. During stages one and two, we may mumble out loud, although our speech is usually unintelligible. Stage three is characterized by progressively deeper sleep, and vital signs, like our blood pressure and heart rate, will drop. We'll also be harder to awaken. Stage four is an even deeper state of sleep, during which we might engage in sleep walking or other actions that seem intentional. The final stage, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is the stage when most sleepers report dreaming. Throughout this stage most people literally cannot move, and are thus prevented from acting out their dreams.

An adult Jersey cow weighs about 900 to 1,200 pounds, on average, and consumes over 50 pounds of feed a day. Throughout a lifetime, a Jersey cow can yield about 13,000 pounds of milk. Because this milk is higher in butterfat than that of any other breed, it is a favorite among makers of butter, cheese, and ice cream. Holstein cows are larger than Jerseys and are distinguished by their white and black markings. A mature Holstein cow, which weighs about 1,500 pounds, consumes more than 92 pounds of feed a day.

But the addition of the fork to table cutlery occurred only in recent centuries. About a thousand years ago, European hosts provided dinner guests with spoons to scoop up foods that couldn't be eaten with fingers. Most people carried their own knives -- multi-purpose tools used for centuries to hunt and for defense -- to jab food and raise it to the mouth. Though used in ancient Greece as long kitchen tools to remove meat from boiling cauldrons or a fire, forks were relatively late to catch on in Europe. About 600 years ago, forks started to be employed in Europe to eat candied fruits or to avoid touching foods that could stain the fingers. In the next centuries, table forks evolved from two straight to four curved tines, facilitating scooping and keeping food from falling before it reached the mouth.

Before the pistons in an automobile engine can begin moving, and ultimately set the engine in motion, something must act as a source of energy. Originally, a hand crank was used to provide the energy. However, turning the hand crank could be both labor-intensive and dangerous. Fortunately, this process was made easier and safer in 1911 with the invention of the electric starter. The electric starter uses energy from the car's battery to turn a flywheel connected to the engine. This flywheel in turn starts the motion of the pistons. The electric starter made starting a car as easy as turning a key.

Before this rapid brain growth begins in a newborn, some key events in brain development have already taken place even before birth. The neural tube has differentiated into what will soon become the brain. The formation and organization of synapses, which help form connections between nerve impulses, begins. After birth, synaptic density increases quickly at first, but then some of these connections are eliminated due to redundancy or underuse. About three months before birth, myelination of brain neurons begins. Myelination of the brain cells that control basic survival reflexes is nearly complete at birth.

Cricket is played on a field that has a central area called a pitch. On each end of the pitch is a wicket, composed of three 28-inch-tall wooden stumps on top of which rest two horizontal sticks or bails. Each wicket is protected by a batsman. To start the play, a bowler on the opposing team throws a ball toward one of the wickets in an attempt to knock off the bails. The batsman protecting that wicket tries to hit the ball away from it. If the ball is hit within the field, the batter runs toward the opposite end of the pitch, exchanging positions with the other batsman (a teammate). The batter is out if a player on the bowler's team retrieves the ball and knocks the bails off the wicket before the batter and the teammate reach their destinations.

When water is released from a cloud, it is called precipitation and might be in the form of rain, sleet, hail, or snow. The precipitation flows downhill (above ground or underground), eventually collecting in rivers, oceans, or other bodies of water. This water is called runoff. Water on the earth's surface is eventually warmed by the sun. The heat changes the liquid water to water vapor. During this step, called evaporation, the water vapor enters the atmosphere in its gaseous, or vaporous, form.

Too much algae makes it difficult for an aquatic ecosystem to function properly, as decaying algae use up the oxygen present in the water. Without enough oxygen, other living things, such as fish and shellfish, die out. Furthermore, algae can create toxins that are hazardous to any animal that ingests them. Eutrophication, particularly in lakes, often occurs naturally over time, but all too often this process is accelerated by human activities. The runoff from fertilizer used in farming and the discharge from sewers are two common causes of eutrophication.

Several events weakened the Incan empire before Pizarro's men even took a first shot, though. Beginning in 1438, the Inca conquered most of the tribes in the Andes region. Keeping the territory of the conquered enemies under control required constant vigilance by the small group of Incan rulers. In 1527 smallpox swept through the empire killing thousands, including the Inca king, who died without leaving a successor. The resulting civil war, in which two competitors battled for leadership, debilitated the empire. In 1532 Pizarro ambushed and captured the new Inca king as well as the capital city of Cusco, extracting huge amounts of gold and silver as ransom for the king, who was later executed.

Gradually people developed ideograms, more abstract symbols to represent concepts. The Aztecs, for instance, used the symbols of a shield and club to signify war. In some parts of the world, people started using logograms, signs that represent words or parts of words but that do not indicate pronunciation. The best known examples are Chinese and Japanese characters. The final development in the history of writing was the alphabet, in which symbols have no meaning but merely stand for different sounds. This principle was applied in the development of writing for many languages.

Based on the passage, what did people typically invent right after they had developed pictographs?

A.	symbols that communicated ideas
B.	characters that represented objects
C.	alphabets that stood for units of sound
D.	logograms that expressed parts of words

After pulling together his financial records, he recorded his regular sources of income (cash inflows) in a notebook. Then he jotted down his monthly cash outflows, which he broke down into fixed expenses, including rent and insurance payments; variable spending, including groceries and utility bills; and discretionary spending, including entertainment and recreation. When Wally discovered his outflows exceeded his inflows, he realized that he needed to reduce his discretionary spending or find a way to generate more income. Soon he cancelled his membership to the gym and got a second job, and today Wally is the proud owner of a new car.

Based on the passage, what did Wally do immediately before he realized he was spending more than he made?

A.	decided against borrowing money
B.	reduced his discretionary spending

Spurred by his reports of the potential for a lucrative fur trade, the Dutch West India Company in 1624 sent settlers to establish a colony named New Amsterdam on what is now Manhattan, New York. Soon after, the Dutch founded other nearby communities on present-day Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx, and built a fort to protect the colony from conflicts with the English and Native Americans who opposed further expansion. Then in 1664 British warships appeared in New Amsterdam. Peter Stuyvesant, governor of the colony, was persuaded by a petition of leading citizens to surrender peacefully. The colony was renamed New York after the Duke of York, brother of the British king, and the Dutch influence lingers there today.

Begin by laying everything you plan to take on the bed. Then roll each item of clothing into a neat cylinder to maximize space and minimize wrinkles. Stuff socks and underwear into shoes and place them around the edges of your suitcase. Next, place the rolls of heavier clothes, such as pants and jackets, in your bag; follow up with the rolls of lighter-weight items, such as shirts and tops, to form a second layer. Fill in small spaces with belts, chargers, and other little accessories. After placing travel-size toiletries in an air-tight bag, set it on the top. Finally, secure the internal straps to keep items from shifting during travel.

According to the author, immediately after packing shoes in your suitcase you should

A.	fill in spaces with small accessories.

When creating a backyard vegetable garden, however, your soil will probably need some help. Begin by testing the nutrient levels of your soil with a soil test kit to determine if any soil amendments are needed. After removing existing weeds and other unwanted plant material, loosen the soil by digging down several inches and turning over the soil with a shovel. Renting a rototiller will make this step much easier. The fourth step is to add compost and any nutrients to the soil as determined by the soil test. Mix these amendments into the top 6 to 12 inches of soil. Next, create a smooth, uniform surface by raking the soil and removing any sticks, rocks, or other debris as you go. This sounds like a lot of work, but remember that healthy plants grow in healthy soil!

According to the passage, what should you do just before adding soil amendments?

A.	loosen the soil
B.	rake the surface of the soil
C.	remove any weeds from the soil

The next day newspapers across the country reported Lindsay's discovery of the ""bus boy poet."" In 1926 the bus boy, Langston Hughes, went on to publish his first collection of poetry, The Weary Blues, which attracted considerable attention for its innovative use of musical rhythm, inclusion of blues lyrics, and its focus on the strength and determination of black people in America. In the years following his encounter with Lindsay, Hughes became one of the leading writers of the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural movement in the 1920s when African-American art, music, and literature flourished.

With a purchase price of $825, the Model T was a practical and reliable means of transportation that the average worker could afford. Then in 1913 Ford revolutionized the industry by adopting the moving assembly line, which decreased production time dramatically, thus lowering the price of a Model T even further. Sales skyrocketed. The 20 horsepower engine yielded a top speed of 45 miles per hour; several models were available, all built with the same engine and frame. During the 1920s, however, the market share of the Model T began to decline. It could not compete with automakers offering bigger, more powerful, or more luxurious cars; and its production was halted in 1927.

The performance combines acting, singing, music, and dance to tell a story, which is usually taken from traditional literature. The tone is serious, the content usually tragic. The stage, a square wooden platform, is undecorated except for a single pine tree painted onto the backdrop. There are generally only two actors. The supporting actor opens the drama by describing the scene. The principal actor wears a mask and reenacts the tale, using highly stylized movements, while the chorus, seated at the edge of the stage, sings the lines to the accompaniment of a flute and drums. A Noh program lasts all day and includes several works, interspersed with brief, one-act plays to provide comic relief.

This means that a wheat farmer might use the global positioning system (GPS) monitor on a tractor to pinpoint its exact location in the field. In the early days of the family farm, farmers used practical experience to manage their crops. They used their knowledge of weather variables to schedule irrigation, for example. But since farms are now spread over thousands of acres, farmers need satellite-based remote sensing to monitor a wide range of variables that affect their crops — such as soil moisture, surface temperature, and pest infestations. Precision farming reduces costs by targeting the use of fertilizer, seeds, water, and pesticides to precisely where they are needed.

Aromatherapy and skin care products are sometimes marketed with claims that their use will improve personal well-being, by ""strengthening the body's self-defense mechanisms"" or reversing the signs of aging. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), perfumes have traditionally been considered cosmetics, and cosmetics are used ""for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance."" On the other hand, any product ""intended for use in the diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease"" and ""intended to affect the structure or any function of the body"" is considered a drug, requiring the FDA's premarket approval. Some products meet the definitions of both cosmetic and drug. For example, an antidandruff shampoo is a cosmetic, since it cleanses the hair, but it is also a drug, since it treats dandruff. Companies sometimes violate the law by marketing a cosmetic as a drug, and vice versa.

A useful family health history includes three generations of biological relatives and indicates their age when diagnosed with any health problem. For deceased family members, the age and cause of death is also important to record. Family members share not only their genes, but often their environment, lifestyles, and habits.

According to the Office of Naval Research, the Archimedes principle, or law of buoyancy, states that ""any body partly or completely submerged in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body."" Gravity acts on the weight of any floating object, pulling it downward. However, the force from the displaced water acts upward. The object floats if the density, or weight per unit of volume, of the floating object and the displaced water is equal. As stated, though, the principle also applies to submerged objects. A fish, which uses air sacs to help it sink or rise in the water, is a good example.

In the early 1920s a writer for the New York Morning Telegraph wrote that jockeys everywhere desired to race horses in the Big Apple, a reference to the popularity of the racetracks around New York City. It is thought that ""Big Apple,"" in this case, referred either to the hefty prizes awarded to race winners or to the idea that an apple was at that time a special treat. Around the same time, jazz musicians used the phrase in a similar way: to perform in the City represented the big time or the Big Apple.

Fortunately, its prehensile tail is well-suited for grasping onto stationary objects. While its appearance is distinct, it can be altered through camouflage. The ability to camouflage helps the seahorse to avoid detection by predators. As for mating, non-captive male and female seahorses participate in a lengthy courtship and, once a partner is found, remain monogamous (mate for life). This relationship leads to what might be the most interesting characteristic: the fact that the male stores the eggs in a pouch on its stomach and gives birth to the babies.

The air that travels over the top of the curved wings moves more quickly than the air that travels below them. This means that there is also a difference in the amount of air pressure above and below the wings. The explanation for why fast-moving air exerts less pressure than slow-moving air, when disturbed by an object, was discovered long before the invention of the airplane by a Swiss mathematician named Daniel Bernoulli and is known as Bernoulli's principle. Because the air moves more slowly below a plane's wing, the amount of air pressure pushing up on the wing is greater than the amount of air pressure pushing down. Therefore, as an airplane's engine generates forward thrust, the airplane is able rise from the ground.

The passage implies that

A.	lift is acting on an airplane whenever it is airborne.
B.	airplanes rely on high-altitude wind currents to rise.
C.	airplanes only need engines for takeoff and landing.
D.	certain types of airplanes do not have curved wings.

Before becoming a presidential candidate in a primary election, a prudent person may ""test the waters"" to find out how much voter support he or she actually has. However, once someone advertises publically about the intention to run, refers to oneself as a candidate, or seeks ballot access, that person indicates he or she has decided to be a candidate, and any monetary contributions to or expenditures made on testing-the-waters activities must be reported as such. Also, as soon as more than $5,000 has been raised or spent on a campaign, the official process of registering and filing candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission must begin. In most states, a candidate who loses the primary election may run in the general election as an Independent or as a third-party candidate.

The passage suggests that the first step to be taken by a cautious individual who wants to run in a presidential primary is to

A.	win the nomination of a political party in an early election.
B.	register as a candidate with the Federal Election Committee.
C.	advertise endorsement of the candidacy by influential groups.

In the past few decades, homeschooling has become an increasingly popular option among parents. Many parents choose the homeschool option because of the abundant flexibility it offers and the opportunities it provides for family bonding. One of the greatest benefits of homeschooling is that children are provided with more individual attention that is tailored to their interests and abilities. Furthermore, homeschooling offers parents more freedom in deciding what their children will learn. Public education, while it has many benefits, does not usually offer parents this kind of control.

Using the two terms interchangeably is inaccurate, however, as there is a major difference between classic cars and vintage cars. Classic cars and vintage cars are classified based on their age, with vintage cars being the older of the two. Vintage cars are generally defined as those that were produced between 1919 and 1930. However, this definition varies among experts. Some say that 1930 is the cutoff year, but others contend that 1925 marks the last year of the vintage era. A car is generally classified as a classic car if it was produced between 1925 and 1948. Therefore, a car produced in 1925 could be categorized as a classic car or a vintage one, depending on the expert assessing the vehicle. Determining this distinction for a particular car is important for collectors, as the classification will often affect the price.

The passage implies that

Many parents fail to take into account safety considerations when constructing a playroom. It is this inattention to safety that can lead to accidents in the home. A playroom should be a space where children can play independently without adult supervision. As such, safety considerations should be the most important aspect for parents when designing a room for children to play in. Parents should choose furniture pieces that are durable, age-appropriate, and pose little threat of injury to kids. Anything with sharp edges or corners should be avoided, and heavy objects should be securely anchored. Additionally, all electric outlets should be equipped with safety plugs.

The passage suggests that

A.	accidents occur most commonly in playrooms.

She experienced an impoverished upbringing with an alcoholic father and, after failing at several careers as a young adult, became determined to be financially responsible for herself. Women writers at the time were viewed with skepticism and contempt, and Wollstonecraft faced many challenges, including derision from the few fellow women writers who lived in London. Fortunately, Wollstonecraft met Joseph Johnson, an influential publisher who was known for publishing the works of radical thinkers and little-known authors. Johnson published Wollstonecraft's most famous work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, in 1792, which argued for women to be treated as individuals and has been influential in the centuries since.

Prehistoric stone tools found in the early 1930s near Clovis, New Mexico, were determined by archeologists to be representative of the ""Clovis"" culture, whose people were long believed to be the first inhabitants of the New World. The prevailing thought was that these stone-age hunters, coming over a land bridge from eastern Asia approximately 13,500 years ago, spread throughout the Americas. However, this theory has recently crumbled in the face of several archaeological sites that predate Clovis. Evidence of humans at sites in Chile, Brazil, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina was determined to be older than that of Clovis, and now a much greater mystery exists: how did these ancestors arrive in the New World? Whether they boated from Australia to South America, or from Europe to eastern North America, or travelled along the Alaskan coastline are hypotheses that can be proven only by finding more archeological data.

This passage suggests that

Foodborne illnesses result from the ingestion of pathogens, or disease-causing microorganisms; the most vulnerable people are those with a weakened immune system, the elderly, and young children. Caution should be taken when preparing food, to guard against cross-contamination from raw eggs, meats, and poultry. Clean all surfaces, including your hands, thoroughly with soap and water. Temperature is important: cook food to an internal temperature of at least 140°F, reheat animal products to at least 165°F, and refrigerate leftovers if they are not to be consumed within four hours. Finally, all suspected foodborne illnesses should be reported to your local health department for investigation.

However, looking at Godzilla's origins during his initial movie debut in 1954, one sees that he was a reflection of Japanese society's fears of atomic radiation at the time. Godzilla lay dormant on the floor of the ocean until he was awakened by American atomic tests, spewing radioactive breath. When introduced to American audiences two years later, nearly all references to the dangers of atomic weapons in the movie were cut. Additionally, the many sequels and remakes that pit Godzilla against an increasingly comic array of foes served to dilute the original message. In the twenty-first century, with the fear of atom bombs no longer predominant, horror movies trend toward society's current fears, such as unseen villains, deadly diseases, and terror strikes.

These days, biology is not the only field with which ethnobotanists must be familiar. Many times an understanding of linguistics, anthropology, and ecology is necessary to fully understand how a native plant is used by its surrounding human culture.

But archaeologists believe that the first human-cultivated potatoes were grown in the Andean highlands of South America at least 7,000 years ago. Potato-growing areas of South America were under Inca control during the Spanish invasion of the 1500s, and the Spanish are credited with introducing potatoes to Europe. In the late 1600s, the British brought potatoes to India and China. Productive when planted with seaweed and requiring minimal land, the potato crop became important to Ireland around 1650. Although wild potatoes in South America included hundreds of species, the early European varieties all descended from one original cultivated species. This created a narrow gene pool that left potatoes vulnerable to fungal blights that could cause widespread crop failure, which, in turn, resulted in over a million deaths during the Irish Potato Famine in the 1840s.

The Gros Michel variety used to dominate U.S. sales until a soil fungus, causing Panama disease, struck in the 1900s, completely devastating the crop by the late 1960s. The Cavendish became the replacement variety, because it resisted Panama disease, grew quickly, and could withstand handling. Throughout the past decade, however, Cavendish plantations in Asia and Africa have been destroyed by a new strain of the same fungus that caused Panama disease.

Carrying cloth-covered baskets harboring king cobras, snake charmers used to be able to support their families on donations from onlookers who stood transfixed by the flute-playing and responsiveness of seemingly dangerous snakes. But the charmers are respected no more than beggars now. The Wildlife Protection Act, passed in India in 1972, included a ban on pet snakes, though it was not enforced against snake charmers until the last decade. The ban addressed the fact that many charmers defanged the cobras or sewed their mouths shut, a practice seen as cruel in modern times. The proliferation of nature documentaries on cable television also demystified snakes for city dwellers, leaving them uncharmed by the snake charmers' skills.

Companies began manufacturing jogging shoes in the 1970s and have had decades to research and develop better footwear for running, yet about a third of runners suffer injuries each year. Knowing that our human ancestors were runners who often chased prey on foot, this injury rate seems high. One possible explanation is that these ancestors, running barefoot or wearing simply thin sandals or moccasins, were injured less frequently because they landed on the mid- or front-portion of their foot. This is in contrast to many modern day runners who land first on their heels. Landing repeatedly on the heels can cause runners a painful condition called heel strike, which can be avoided by learning to improve how the feet connect with the ground. Different types of running, such as long distance or sprinting, call for different approaches to land effectively.

Areas east of the line are one day later than areas west of it. Established for convenience in the 1800s by international agreement, without the force of law, the line's location has changed over time. The Philippines was originally located east of the line so travelers from other Spanish colonies, mostly those in South America, would not have to adjust dates. In 1845, with the independence of the South American countries, the line was adjusted, putting the Philippines on the western side and thus aligning it with neighboring countries. When the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the line was adjusted to change the date in Alaska, until then one day ahead of the U.S. More recently, another change allowed the Republic of Kiribati, which straddled the International Date Line, to be entirely on the western side of the line.

A study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture assessed the effect of recreation and tourism development on 311 rural U.S. counties. Findings indicate that, in general, this type of development contributes to rural well-being by increasing local employment, wages, and income. However, some local officials criticize the socioeconomic impacts of such development, arguing that the tourism industry — consisting mainly of hotels, restaurants, and other service-oriented businesses — offers seasonal, unskilled, low-wage jobs that depress local wages and income. As more of a county's workforce is employed in these jobs, tourism could increase local poverty and adversely affect the levels of education, health, and other aspects of community welfare. In addition, the rapid growth associated with recreation and tourism development could strain the local infrastructure, leading to problems such as road congestion.

Some mangroves have a unique way of reproducing. Each tree produces many new seeds, about 300 per year. But these seeds do not fall from the tree to the soil below; instead, each seed stays attached to the parent tree, extracting nutrients as it grows. Over time, the seed grows into a tiny tree, complete with roots. When conditions are optimal, the tender seedling drops into the water below and drifts away to a new location. When it reaches suitable soil, the seedling hoists itself upright by spreading its roots, and it sprouts new leaves.

The rapid development that was achieved in this period was due in large part to foreign trade. As contrasted with water transportation, land carriage was prohibitively expensive.

The search for safer insecticides, for the military and the public, is being done by the USDA in partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and industry. One noteworthy invention to emerge from this research is new compounds that can be put into cuffs and collars of uniforms. Currently, uniforms are treated with a compound that protects only the skin directly beneath the cloth, leaving the exposed skin nearby vulnerable to bites. The new compounds would create a barrier around the entire soldier, decreasing the need to apply any repellents to the skin. Although this finding is geared specifically toward the military, it may hold promise for the public as well.

In discussing the new insect repellant compounds, the author's primary focus is on the

A.	three insecticide research partners.
B.	reduction of insect-borne diseases.
C.	protection of skin covered by clothing.
D.	protective shield created around the user.

The first five steps of mitosis, in chronological order, are Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase. In the last phase, Cytokinesis, the parent cell divides and the two cells are produced. In order to assure that the cells are identical, the cell membrane, nuclei, cytoplasm, and all other components are split equally. Mitosis spurs growth in all cell-based organisms. In addition, this process helps the body repair itself as new cells are created when other cells are damaged or die.

It has been home to the first lighthouse on the West Coast, a military fortress, a military prison, and Native American activists who occupied the island during a protest from 1969 to 1972. The most famous use of the island was for a federal penitentiary that opened in 1934. Only one-and-a-half miles from the shores of San Francisco, Alcatraz housed the country's most dangerous criminals, including the well-known gangster Al Capone. The penitentiary was closed by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1963. Since 1973, Alcatraz has been part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, with more than 1.4 million visitors each year.

Rather, they occur due to significant changes in the ocean's floor caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanoes, or landslides. The energy released by one of these events causes a huge amount of water to push upward and form a series of powerful waves. As tsunamis move across the ocean at about 500 miles per hour, their energy is dissipated only slightly. Although the speed of the waves decreases to about 45 miles per hour as they approach land, their energy is concentrated into a smaller volume, and the shallow depth causes the wave heights to increase. The resulting waves can reach heights of 100 feet or more and hit the shore for several hours. It is difficult to gauge the destructive power of a tsunami at first, as the first wave that hits the shore is often not the largest in the series.

The main point of the passage is that tsunamis

Approximately 4.5 billion years old, scientists believe that the Sun will continue to burn for another five billion years. As for the Sun's temperature, its surface is approximately 6,000 degrees Kelvin. However, a region called the corona, which extends far into space above the Sun's surface, can reach 1,000,000 degrees Kelvin. The giant mass of the Sun is composed of approximately 70% hydrogen and 25% helium. The remaining amount is composed of other elements. Because the Sun is mostly hydrogen gas, it is not a solid body. Therefore, different areas of the Sun rotate at different speeds. For example, it takes the surface at the equator about 25 days to complete one rotation, while it takes the surface near the poles about 36 days.

The water in the Dead Sea comes from the Jordan River and several streams. However, the water that flows in does not flow out, as the Dead Sea is a lake with no outlet. Because the water has nowhere to go, except by evaporation, the salt has nowhere to go and therefore continues to build up. Although the high salt content (3,000 milligrams per liter) makes it impossible for nearly all plants and animals to survive in the water, it is possible for people to swim in it. In fact, it's possible to float on the water's surface with little or no effort. In addition to enjoying this activity, many people visit the Dead Sea because they believe the mineral content in the salt has positive health benefits.

The fort's commander, George Armistead, proudly flew an American flag over the fort when the battle ended. It was the sight of that flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" which became the national anthem of the United States. Originally, this celebrated flag measured an impressive 30 feet by 42 feet and had fifteen stars and fifteen stripes. The flag is smaller now and is missing one of its stars, due to the Armistead family donating pieces of it to various officials.

Trade embargoes are often used by countries as political tools to protest actions taken by another country. In some cases, travel to the prohibited country is banned by the imposing country. A classic example of a trade embargo is the one imposed against Cuba by the United States in 1962. This embargo was enacted because the United States opposed the dictatorship of Fidel Castro and hoped to encourage the people of Cuba to overthrow Castro and establish a democratic government. Another example is the United Nations Security Council's embargo against trading military arms with Rwanda in 1994, in opposition to that country's violence against ethnic subgroups. While embargoes set strict rules regarding contact between countries, there are exceptions, such as natural disasters, in which aid may be given to a prohibited country.

Their reputation for being man-eaters is inaccurate. Most species, in fact, eat discarded edibles or feed on fruits, nuts, and other vegetation. When humans are bitten, it is likely because the piranhas are defending themselves or their nests. The most infamous species is the red-bellied piranha. It has not only the strongest jaw of all of these fish, but also the sharpest teeth. This species sometimes hunts in groups of more than 100 piranhas. Although red-bellied piranhas prefer prey close to their own size, in some rare instances several hunting groups will attack a large animal, creating a feeding frenzy.

Based on the passage, the majority of piranha species

A.	hunt in groups.
B.	regularly bite humans.
C.	prefer to eat large animals.
D.	scavenge for food or eat plants.

During the developing stage, a towering cumulus cloud indicates rising air and usually there is little, if any, rain. This first stage lasts about 10 minutes and can include occasional lightning. The mature stage is the most likely time for hail, heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong winds, and tornadoes. The storm can appear black or green during this stage, which lasts an average of 10 to 20 minutes but can persist much longer. The final stage, dissipating, is dominated by downdrafts, which are downward flowing air. Rainfall decreases in intensity, although storms can still produce bursts of strong winds, and lightning remains a danger.

Based on the passage, when is the most likely time for tornadoes?

A.	during the mature stage

Puffins, Auks and Murres are all sea birds and are only found inland when blown there by some severe storm of winter. At this season numbers of them are apt to lose their bearings and may sometimes be found with their feet frozen in some of our inland ponds. Puffins are heavily built birds in appearance, but are very active both on the wing and in the water. Their wings are much larger comparatively than those of the other members of this family, so they are enabled to perform evolutions in the air, which are withheld from the others. They stand upright on the sole of the foot and are able to walk quite easily on land. Puffins have very heavy and deep but thin bills, which are entirely unlike those of any other bird and often give them the name of Parrot Auks. Puffins, Auks and Murres are otherwise recognized by the presence of but three toes which are webbed.

Elizabeth I became the Queen of England six years before Shakespeare's birth. During her reign, London became a cultural and commercial center where learning thrived. Queen Elizabeth recognized the importance of the arts to the life and legacy of her nation. She was fond of the theater, and many of England's greatest playwrights were active during her reign, including Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, and William Shakespeare. With her permission, professional theaters were built in England for the first time, attracting 15,000 theatergoers per week in London, a city of 150,000 to 250,000. In addition to Shakespeare's masterpieces, Marlowe's Doctor Faustus and Jonson's Volpone were also written during this golden age of literary arts.

0126.	The playwright William Shakespeare composed much of his plays in the form of poetry, often in a meter called iambic pentameter. A regular line of the meter contains roughly ten syllables, with heavier stresses falling on every other syllable. An iamb is a metrical unit, or a ""foot"" of meter, made up of one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable (""alive,"" ""forget,"" ""a dog""). Pentameter refers to the number of iambs in the line (penta is the Greek word for five, as in a pentagon). So there are five iambs in a line of iambic pentameter. Here is an example from Romeo and Juliet ('bold' means stressed and 'italics' means unstressed): But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? Even today, iambic pentameter is the most common meter used in English-language poetry.

Before she was a year old, her family moved to Griff, where they would reside until Eliot reached adulthood. Between 1828 and 1832, Eliot attended boarding school in Nuneaton, where she was heavily influenced by the school's governess, who instilled a strong religious sensibility in her. From 1832 to 1835, in the nearby town of Coventry, Eliot attended another school administered by daughters of a Baptist minister. Her education was cut short at age 17 when her mother died. Being the youngest child, she returned home to run her father's household. In 1841 she and her father moved to Coventry, where Eliot met Caroline and Charles Bray and was influenced by them to embrace more progressive ideas. After her father's death, Eliot advanced her education through her own intensive reading. These experiences, localities, and people of her childhood are echoed throughout her novels.

At times, he would forget his book while listening to the music of the birds, or gazing at the peonies and tulips, but he would soon think again of his lesson, and commence studying with new zeal. He was to recite in an hour, so he had wisely chosen a comfortable place, and bravely resolved to conquer his lesson as soon as possible. All at once the yellow cat, which had been watching on the wall, sprang at a beautiful red bird and tumbled down with it at Henry's feet.

Have you ever tried to throw a brick? It went in the direction that you threw it. This is the idea behind the monkey's fist. This knot is also used in similar applications such as on fishing nets to aid in throwing them where desired or on lines thrown between ships to pull them together.

They lay at anchor in the harbors of France or sallied forth into the open sea to the southward to prey upon the commerce of Great Britain. But grand as they were, not one of them dared to do what John Paul Jones did in the little Continental sloop of war, Ranger.

The process begins by letting our thoughts flow freely and then sorting out the ones useful to our problem from the many that came to mind.

Even how the flag is folded is symbolic -- it is meant to hark back to the tricorn hats worn during the Revolutionary War. Folding the flag is precise and requires two people. First, one holds the flag at the hoist end and the other at the fly end. Next, fold the flag lengthwise in half. Bring the stripes over the stars. Then, fold the flag lengthwise in half again. This time bring the stars over the stripes. Next, beginning at the fly end, fold the bottom edge over to the open side. This forms a triangle fold. Then, flip the triangle toward the hoist end to make the next fold. Continue in this manner until the flag is folded.

It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down -- but with a shudder even more thrilling than before -- upon the remodeled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.

Not only did Tolkien create unforgettable characters, he created entire genealogies with intertwining histories. A skilled linguist, Tolkien also designed several ""ancient"" languages that were entirely coherent, with complete speech and symbol systems. His ultimate goal was to create a comprehensive mythology for his native land of England, which he felt lacked one, continuing the lineage of great Nordic and Anglo-Saxon heroic legends, such as Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The result of Tolkien's tireless and unparalleled aspirations were the masterpieces The Hobbit and the multivolume The Lord of the Rings, which today are among the most beloved works of literature in the world.

In the passage, the author describes J. R. R. Tolkien largely in terms of

A.	the number of books he wrote.

Maris accomplished many feats in his career, including perhaps the most famous feat ever accomplished by a baseball player: in 1961, he hit 61 home runs in one season, breaking the legendary record of 60 held by Babe Ruth. Maris's record stood for 37 years, three more years than Ruth's, when it was broken in 1998. Maris won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 1961, his second consecutive MVP award, leading the Yankees to the World Series. The following year, Maris again led the Yankees to a championship, hitting 33 home runs, the most on the team. In 1967, Maris was traded to the Cardinals, who became champions as Maris led the team with seven runs batted in during the World Series.

The author of the passage is most likely trying to

Arriving in the United States in 1777, L'Enfant was among the first French volunteers of the Continental Army, serving as an officer in the Corps of Engineers. He spent the harsh winter of 1777 in Valley Forge under the command of George Washington who, after the Revolutionary War, appointed L'Enfant to design the insignia for the Society of the Cincinnati. For this assignment, L'Enfant chose to use the image of a bald eagle, which endures today as an important symbol of American strength, courage, and freedom. It was also George Washington who, eight years later, would commission L'Enfant to design the nation's capital. L'Enfant's other notable works include the remodeling of Federal Hall in New York and the design and layout of Perrysburg, Ohio.

Mosquito larvae, for example, living exclusively in water, provide food for fish and other aquatic organisms, including other insect larvae, such as dragonflies. Mosquito larvae also function as filter feeders that help eliminate organic debris and microorganisms found in water. Adult mosquitoes provide food for a vast array of animals and insects, including spiders, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies, salamanders, and several types of birds and fish. The fact remains, however, that mosquitoes are not only annoying but are also dangerous; they spread several diseases, convincing many to believe that, in spite of the many ecological functions of mosquitoes, the world would be a better place without them.

Which of the following best states the main point of the passage about mosquitoes?

While many have continued to use it as a remedy for colds and other illnesses, skeptics have often questioned the soup's true medicinal qualities. Some studies have shown, however, that chicken soup may actually possess healing properties. For example, in reaction to a cold virus, the body often responds with inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. When inflammation is present, the body sends white blood cells to fight infection. Unable to kill the virus, the accumulated white blood cells have the side effect of stimulating mucus production, leading to cold symptoms. One study found that chicken soup seems to lessen this natural response of migrating white blood cells, decreasing symptoms such as stuffy head, running nose, and sneezing.

The author most likely wrote the passage about chicken soup to

A.	provide an interesting and amusing history of its use as a medicine.

One of the best foods a person can eat is the avocado. Not only are avocados delicious and versatile, they are also highly nutritious. Considered a ""superfood"" -- rich in nutrients that offer many health benefits -- avocados contain vital nutrients such as fiber, folic acid, potassium, vitamin E, and magnesium. Avocados also contain oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat that helps to lower cholesterol and increase fat metabolism, as well as antioxidants, which help to protect cells in the body. Also, the sugar contained in avocados, known as D-mannoheptulose, has been found to boost collagen formation, slowing wrinkles and skin aging. Best of all, avocados can be easily worked into anyone's diet, as they can be used in a variety of ways, such as in salads, soups, sushi, guacamole, sandwiches, veggie dips, and even ice cream.

Many injuries occur when people inside a building attempt to leave. Instead, crawl under a desk or table, if one is available, or crouch into an interior corner of the building and cover your head with your arms. Stay away from all exterior walls, glass, light fixtures, appliances, fireplaces, and heavy furniture, such as bookcases and dressers. Note that contrary to popular belief, standing in a doorway is not a good idea. Most modern doorways are no stronger than the rest of the building. You're also likely to get injured by the swinging door or people trying to rush through it. Remain inside until the shaking stops. When it stops, determine if it is safe to move. Then, carefully exit the building.

There are three primary types of distractions: visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distractions cause you to take your eyes off the road; manual distractions cause you to take your hands off the steering wheel; and cognitive distractions keep you from concentrating on driving. Being subject to just one of these types is dangerous enough. The use of a cell phone, however, especially if texting, combines all three distractions, and is extremely hazardous behind the wheel. According to a study from a leading university, sending or receiving a text message takes the driver's eyes off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds -- the equivalent of blindly driving the length of an entire football field at 55 miles per hour. Texting while driving is arguably worse than drinking and driving. It is unfortunately still commonplace.

Whether these places are private or public, indoors or outdoors, or rooms, buildings, or complexes, architects are responsible for their design. Architects discuss with clients the objectives, requirements, and budget of a project. In some cases, architects provide various predesign services such as feasibility and environmental impact studies, site selection, cost analyses and land-use studies, and design requirements. For example, architects may determine a building's space requirements by researching its number and types of potential users. After discussing and agreeing on the initial proposal, architects develop final construction plans that show the building's appearance and details for its construction. Accompanying these plans are drawings of the structural system; air-conditioning, heating, and ventilating systems; electrical systems; communications systems; plumbing; and, possibly, site and landscape plans.

First, think about the amount of sun needed for the types of plants you want to grow; for example, most vegetables need plenty of sun. You should also use your space wisely; plants shouldn't be too crowded. One option is to start out small with a 10-foot square space. It might help to keep you from feeling overwhelmed, and you can still get a lot of food out of it. Successful gardening also requires good timing. You'll need to pay attention to air and soil temperatures when planting; when temperatures are low, some plants won't germinate. Lastly, plan when you're going to water your vegetables.

They do this by contracting the muscles around their venom glands and then spurting venom through their fangs. If any venom happens to get onto the cornea of the predator's eye, the result is intense pain and a chance of blindness. Venom that hits an attacker's skin or even the inside of an attacker's mouth does no damage. Because of this, some have surmised that cobras intentionally aim for the eyes. One study, however, appears to disprove this. Researchers found that cobras spit about as often at face-shaped boards with eyes as they did at those without eyes. Because the cobras did spit at larger targets more than at smaller ones, the researchers concluded that cobras merely aim for the center of the body part the attacker puts closest to them.

In 1845, entrepreneur Asa Whitney presented a resolution to Congress for funding a railroad that would extend to the Pacific. The bill failed before Congress, but with the discovery of gold in California, plans for a transcontinental railroad came back into the spotlight in 1848. It wasn't until 1862, however, that Congress passed the Pacific Railroad Bill, giving cash and land grants to two railroad companies. California-based Central Pacific began laying tracks in Sacramento, heading east. Eastern-based Union Pacific began laying tracks in Omaha, heading west.

""They are blended,"" said he, ""I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good. … Were she your equal in situation -- but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honor, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her -- and before her niece, too ….

In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on weekdays he made a brave figure in his best homespun.

The walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and doors of cutting winds. There were more than a hundred halls there, according as the snow was driven by the winds. The largest was many miles in extent; all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora Borealis, and all were so large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never reigned there; there was never even a little bear-ball, with the storm for music, while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off their steps. Never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes; vast, cold, and empty were the halls of the Snow Queen…. In the middle of the empty, endless hall of snow, was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a thousand pieces, but each piece was so like the other, that it seemed the work of a cunning artificer. In the middle of this lake sat the Snow Queen.

One legendary success was the use of the ""Trojan Horse"" by the Greeks during the Trojan War. Other unconventional wartime strategies, however, have not been so successful. One failed offensive occurred during World War II, when Japanese forces dispatched about 10,000 hot air balloons rigged with explosives across the Pacific Ocean. Their hope was that the balloons would detonate upon landing in the United States and start massive forest fires that would distract their enemy's focus away from the Pacific theater. It did not work though -- a large percentage of the balloons were lost at sea, while the few that landed either failed to explode or exploded without causing the anticipated damage.

On several occasions, Alex has come home to find Houdini out of the cage, running around freely. During the day, Alex worries that he may have forgotten to close his bedroom window, which is all the way up on the second floor of the house. He wonders if he forgot to shut his bedroom door -- his parents have two hungry cats that roam the house. He also worries about leaving chocolate and other candy, which are potentially toxic to hamsters, around his room. The last time Houdini escaped, Alex found him underneath the bed with his head stuck inside an empty box of raisins -- the great escape artist had finally met his match! Luckily, raisins are not toxic to hamsters, so Houdini actually succeeded in getting a treat.

Although Christopher Columbus is credited with being the first European to ""discover"" the already inhabited North American continent, many believe that the Norse explorer, Leif Eriksson, arrived first. Some 400 years before Columbus stumbled upon the archipelago now known as the Bahamas, Eriksson travelled to a place he named Vinland. Scholars disagree about where Vinland is -- possibly as far north as Canada's Labrador coast, or as far south as the New England coast. After exploring Vinland, Eriksson and his crew returned to Greenland. A few years later, Norse trader Thorfinn Karlsefni, encouraged by Eriksson's voyage, led a colonizing expedition of over 130 people to Vinland. They stayed for three years, leaving after their interactions with the native people grew unfriendly. The Norse never returned to Vinland after that. Despite these events, Columbus, whose ""discovery"" led to a more permanent colonization, is still largely recognized as the first European in the Americas.

His exceptional capacity, and partly also his peculiarities, call for exceptional measures; and I never did a more beneficial or magnanimous act than when I took my nephew to myself and personally assumed charge of his education. Seeing that (according to Plutarch) a Philip did not think it beneath his dignity to direct the education of his son Alexander and give him the great Aristotle for a teacher because he did not consider the ordinary teachers suitable, and a Laudon looked after the education of his son himself, why should not such beautiful and sublime examples be followed by others? Already during his lifetime his father entrusted my nephew to me and I confess that I feel myself better fitted than anybody else to incite my nephew to virtue and industry by my own example.

The violinist was to dress like an everyday person in a T-shirt, jeans, and a baseball cap and bring his priceless violin down to a subway station in Washington, D.C., during rush hour. There, for forty minutes, he would play intricate musical masterpieces by several great composers. The point of the experiment was to determine whether people would recognize artistic beauty in unexpected contexts. Out of thousands of passersby, only a handful paused to listen to the music. Most of these, however, would look down at their watches after a few seconds and continue on. The large majority of people did not notice anything unusual at all. Interestingly, every child stopped to listen and attempted to stay longer before their parents would whisk them away.

Overfishing occurs when fish are taken from the ocean at a rate that is unsustainable so that not enough remain to reproduce and replenish the population. Millions of people rely on fish for one of their main food staples, and billions for a source of protein. Further, the continuing depletion of fisheries could significantly impact coastal people worldwide who depend on fishing and the fishing industry for their principal means of income.

Such an ingenious playwright, they claim, must have been a person with the means to obtain a first-rate education. But Shakespeare was born to illiterate parents of the middle class and was believed to be uneducated. Furthermore, he was raised in the modest town of Stratford-upon-Avon and never set foot outside of England. Many of the plays, however, betray an intimate knowledge of Italy, for example. The plays also suggest a playwright who knew several languages, possessed knowledge of politics and law, and was up-to-date on advances in astronomy -- none of which was very likely for a person of Shakespeare's background. While skeptics make a convincing argument, others believe that geniuses can be found in any class of people, and that Shakespeare was one such genius who transcended his class, geography, and lack of formal education.

Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favorite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it.

Verticillium wilt is a disease that results in not only smaller artichoke buds, but also plant ruin. It affects all artichoke varieties. One way to manage this disease is to rotate annual artichoke crops with broccoli. Another artichoke disease is called curly dwarf. This virus is transmitted by insects. Using uninfected plants and removing infected plants can help control this infection. Two weather-related artichoke diseases are bacterial crown rot and botrytis rot. Bacterial crown rot often occurs during hot weather, while botrytis rot is common when it's rainy.

These plates move in various directions and at different speeds. The places where two plates meet are called boundaries, and they are named based on their relationship to other plates. Convergent plate boundaries occur when plates collide, while divergent boundaries are those where plates pull apart. Convergent plates form mountains. Volcanoes can form at convergent and divergent boundaries. Transform boundaries, where plates slide past each other, lack the astonishing features of convergent and divergent boundaries.

Rescue operations ran continuously for over 60 hours and included resources from 16 municipal fire departments. Despite the effort, there were numerous deaths and injuries. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requested an investigation that the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) carried out. The NBS performed onsite inspections, lab tests and other analytical studies, and concluded that both design and construction errors led to the collapse of the fifth floor, resulting in successive collapse of the other floor slabs.

Recycling has also made a vital contribution to job creation and economic development. For example, recycling creates or expands businesses that collect, process, and broker recovered materials. Companies that manufacture and distribute products made with recovered materials have also experienced growth. Billions of dollars have been invested and thousands of jobs have been created by the recycling industry. One study, for example, documents that recycling activity in one state supported more than 8,800 jobs and was a net job creator -- for every 100 jobs created by recycling only an estimated 13 were lost in solid waste collection and disposal and virgin material extraction.

If you do get money back, it may be a great opportunity to start or increase your savings. Some people might save their refund for a large purchase, such as a down payment on a new car or home. Others might save it to finance something just as important, but not quite as tangible, such as their education, or the education of a family member. Still others might focus their savings for future needs or unforeseen emergencies. Whatever reasons you have for saving your refund, getting a lump-sum of money beyond your usual income may not happen very often. Moreover, since you haven't spent it yet, putting it straight into the bank or investing it may be a great way to enhance your personal savings plan.

Based on the passage, getting a refund after filing your federal income tax

A.	is often a surprise for most people.
B.	could be way to finance an education.
C.	will probably happen every year for you.
D.	 is only useful if you put it right into the bank.

Certificates are awarded to individuals upon completion of a higher-education program that does not offer a degree. These programs are often shorter and consequently less expensive than traditional degree paths. Many students complete a certificate program while working at a full-time job. There are a wide variety of industries that rely on certificate programs for qualified employees: personal care services, healthcare, culinary services, computer services, technicians, and mechanics. Certificates are awarded in numbers rivaling, or even surpassing, more traditional degrees such as associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. As with any educational program, do your research before making a decision, but consider certificate programs and what they might have to offer you.

In discussing certificate programs, the author's primary focus is on

A.	their growing popularity today.
B.	the types of certificate programs available.
C.	how they are less expensive than university programs.
D.	the flexibility and economy they offer potential students.

The largest area of the flag is made up of alternating red and white stripes. The upper left corner, known as the canton, is a blue background with white stars. The first flag appeared in the 1770s and had thirteen stripes and thirteen stars, representing each of the original states. As the nation grew, so did the flag -- when new states were added, new stars and stripes were added as well. In 1818, it was decided that the stripes would remain thirteen, to commemorate the original states, and that only the number of stars would increase with each additional state added to the union. Today's flag, with 50 stars and 13 stripes, has been in use since 1960, after Hawaii became the 50th state.

According to the passage, it was decided in 1818 that

The good news is that by changing some small habits, usage can be decreased significantly. For example, washing dishes with the tap on can use up to 20 gallons of water. By filling the sink or a container to hold water, this amount can be cut in half. Changing from a traditional washing machine to an energy efficient washing machine can cut water usage from 50 gallons to 27 gallons per load. Also, when you wash your face or brush your teeth, you can save approximately 7 gallons of water every day if you turn the water off instead of letting it run. Small savings here and there may not seem like much at first, but over time they add up.

According to the passage, people are generally unaware of which of the following?

A.	habitual behaviors that increase water usage
B.	water consumption activities that change over time

Wanda, the first Queen-Regnant of Poland, …. was a talented woman, and esteemed herself fully capable of conducting the government without the assistance of a husband. To the numerous offers of marriage she received, a refusal was the invariable answer. At last Rudiger, a German prince, hoping to bring about a happy union by force of arms, invaded Poland with a great army. Wanda raised troops, and advanced to meet the invaders. When the opposing armies came in sight, Rudiger, believing that his warlike preparations must needs have terrified the queen, besought her to accept him…. Wanda answered that no man should ever share her throne, because he would love her kingdom better than herself. When this spirited answer was spread amongst Rudiger's officers, they refused to fight against so heroic a queen. ...Wanda returned in triumph to Cracow.

She had … promoted his real respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them. -- Three girls … was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.

In its truest form, yoga is considered a way of life. Built on the combination of exercise, breathing, and meditation, yoga is meant to increase an individual's overall health and spiritual enlightenment. The intricate elements of yoga, which include breathing, postures, restraint, healthy observances, sensory withdrawal, concentration, meditation, and higher consciousness, are believed to unite to improve an individual's entire well-being. Although the practice of yoga in the United States did not begin to grow until the 1960s, its health benefits were known before then to aid in stress-reduction and in combating ailments such as back pain, arthritis, and depression. With all of its benefits, yoga can be used in conjunction with Western medical practices to enhance overall well-being.

Believed to have originated in Germany during the 15th century, miniature schnauzers were probably created by crossing standard schnauzers and smaller breeds, such as poodles, affenpinschers, and miniature pinschers. Known for their small but stocky frames, miniature schnauzers are far from fragile. In fact, the normally foot-tall dog is often seen as a fearless and loyal companion to its owners. Although they are not known to be aggressive in nature, the miniature schnauzer has no difficulty protecting itself or its home, making it a very good guard dog. The miniature schnauzer may be a small dog, but it has a lot of courage.

According to the National Park Service, approximately 60 percent of adult bison test positive for exposure to bovine brucellosis, a bacterial disease caused by Brucella abortus that may induce abortions or stillbirths in bison, cattle, and elk. This disease is a concern to ranchers who suffer considerable economic loss from increased testing requirements and the reduced marketability of their herds. In addition, to prevent the spread of brucellosis, ranchers must sometimes resort to slaughtering their cattle. Thus, the United States government and the state of Montana agreed to an Interagency Bison Management Plan in 2000 for cooperatively managing the risk of brucellosis transmission from Yellowstone bison to cattle and conserving bison as a natural component of the ecosystem, including allowing some bison to migrate out of the park. The court-mediated settlement directs federal and state agencies to conduct a variety of management actions to minimize the risk of brucellosis transmission from bison to cattle.

The hints which it is the object of this volume to convey are not meant for experienced archaeologists. They are rather addressed to those who, while anxious to observe and record the antiquities which they may see on their travels, are likely, owing to lack of training, to miss things that may be of importance, or, having observed them, to bring home an imperfect record. It is hoped also that they may catch the attention of some of those who are not interested in the subject, but, coming into possession of antiquities, may unwittingly do incalculable harm by allowing them to be destroyed or dispersed before any record has been made. Most, if not all, of the countries with which we are concerned, have their Laws of Antiquities. It cannot be too strongly insisted that those laws, even if they might be better than they are, should be obeyed by the traveler.

Vegetables don't have seeds because they are generally a plant's leaf, stem, or root. Confusion over what's a fruit and what's a vegetable originates in the kitchen. Most fruits are used for ""sweet"" cooking. Tomatoes, however, like vegetables, are often used for savory, or salty, cooking. For the same reason, several other fruits are also mistaken for vegetables: cucumbers, bell peppers, peas, eggplants, avocados, and squashes. It is less common for people to confuse vegetables for fruits, since not many vegetables are used for sweet cooking. One exception is rhubarb, a sweet vegetable often used to make pie.

Many believe that discovering who she is could lead to uncovering the mystery behind her enigmatic smile. One theory suggests that Leonardo da Vinci, who had a penchant for riddles, created this painting as a self-portrait in disguise, which explains the smile many describe as mischievous. Some say the portrait is a composite of many women. Others say the woman is a complete invention of Leonardo's imagination. Perhaps the leading candidate for Mona Lisa's identity, however, is Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo. At the time Leonardo completed this portrait, Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo would have been pregnant, which might explain Mona Lisa's loose clothing and mysterious smile.

Some minor-league baseball pitchers, compelled by a sore or exhausted pitching arm and driven by desperation to get noticed, will attempt a ""pitch of last resort,"" an unusual and unpredictable pitch that is slow, but hard to hit -- the knuckleball. Though this type of pitch has been used successfully by a handful of major league pitchers, in fact, most knuckleball pitchers never became big league players. Contrasted against the fastball, which travels around 100 miles per hour, the knuckleball is typically thrown below 70 miles per hour. The technique of the knuckleball pitcher is to grip the ball with one's fingernails and to ""push"" the ball toward home plate with as little spin as possible. From there, the ball is subject to air flow that moves the ball in unpredictable motions, creating the perception that the ball zigzags or flutters. No one -- not even the knuckleball pitcher -- knows what it will do, which some claim makes it one of the hardest pitches to hit.

Based on the passage, the knuckleball is sometimes referred to as the ""pitch of last resort"" because it is

Like Mount Rushmore, also located in the Black Hills, the Crazy Horse Memorial is being sculpted into a mountainside. Begun in 1948, the sculpture remains incomplete due to a lack of funding. The sheer size of the monument -- it would be the largest in history if ever completed -- makes the task difficult and expensive. It is the policy of the memorial organization not to take government money, so the completion of the memorial is funded only by private donors and visitors who pay admission fees. It is hoped that one day enough funds will be generated to finish this tribute to one of the most fearless and skilled warriors in American history.

While some said Scott was stifling Zelda's talents, others believed Zelda was jealous of Scott's ability and fame. In the early 1930s, both of them were working on their own novels. Scott's novel Tender Is the Night became a masterpiece; although, he lifted whole passages from Zelda's diaries nearly verbatim. Meanwhile, Zelda's novel, Save Me the Waltz, was, against her will, heavily edited by Scott before publication. Both novels drew upon parts of their life together and Scott, who considered himself the more ""serious"" artist, believed this material to be his alone to use. He cut out many parts from Zelda's novel, leaving the narrative somewhat jagged. In spite of this, Save Me the Waltz was met with several positive reviews.

In spite of all this, a Romeo-and-Juliet-type love affair occurred between Johnson Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy in 1880. Many were left disappointed, however, when their love affair, which gained national interest, was eventually broken up by the McCoy family.

Based on the passage, the feud between the Hatfields and McCoys

A.	started when a McCoy stole livestock from the Hatfield farm.
B.	led to several decades of mutual dislike, hostilities, and grief.

""Physiologists,"" says Dr. Witkowski, ""are quite at issue when they endeavour to determine what kind of instrument the vocal organ resembles; indeed, Galien compares it to a flute, Magendie to a hautboy, Despiney to a trombone, Diday to a hunting-horn, Savart to a bird-catcher's call, Biot to an organ-pipe, Malgaigne to the little instrument used by the exhibitors of Punch, and Ferrein to a spinet or harpsichord. The last-named compared the lips of the glottis to the strings of a violin; hence was given the name Vocal Cords, which they have since retained. The current of air was the bow, the exertion of the chest and lungs the hand which carried the bow, the thyroid cartilages the 'points d'appui,' the arytenoids the pegs, and lastly, the muscles inserted in them the power which tensed or relaxed the cords.""

On August 6, 1945, toward the end of World War II, Yamaguchi was on a business trip to Hiroshima, where he witnessed the Enola Gay, an American B-29 bomber, drop an atomic bomb on the city. Although he was badly burned by the blast, Yamaguchi survived and was taken to his home in Nagasaki, 180 miles away. Three days later, while Yamaguchi was trying to recuperate, the Americans dropped another atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Amazingly, Yamaguchi -- along with his wife and infant son -- survived the blast. He eventually made a full recovery and worked as a translator for the United States, a teacher, and an advocate for nuclear disarmament. He lived to be 93.

In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell thought up the idea that sound could be transported on a current of electricity, which led to the invention of what was then referred to as an ""electrical speech machine."" On March 10, 1876, in his laboratory in Boston, Bell was officially the first person to have his voice heard via telephone, stating: ""Mr. Watson, come here -- I want to see you."" Bell's assistant, Thomas A. Watson, was on the other end of the line, in a different room. To Bell's delight, Watson came walking into his room and confirmed that he heard Bell's voice over the telephone -- an event that transformed the world. Brilliant as he was, however, Bell could have never envisioned the intricate and versatile device that the telephone has become today.

Many people today consider it to be the international lingua franca, which is a language used by native speakers of different languages to communicate with one another. Some attribute English's survival throughout history and its ever-increasing ubiquity to its unique readiness to adopt words from other languages. Its Germanic origins provide its basic vocabulary, but over several centuries, English has incorporated a large number of Latin and French words, making its vocabulary especially vast. As the use of English spread internationally, it absorbed countless words from a great many other languages. Some examples of everyday English words that were adopted from other languages include shampoo from Hindi, ketchup from Chinese, icon from Russian, bagel from Yiddish, umbrella from Italian, caravan from Arabic, and banana, jazz, and zombie from various African languages.

In the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to

During a two-year stretch, however, in the middle of World War II, the Japanese took control of the base, which was heavily damaged after a series of air raids and bombings. The Americans eventually regained control of the base and, after the war ended, completely rebuilt it. Because of its strategic location in the Pacific, the base served as an indispensable supply and ship-repair station during the Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf wars. In spite of its proven usefulness, the base was closed in 1992 when the United States and Philippine governments could not agree on terms of the lease.

His figure and movements were those of a puppet cut out of shingle and jerked by a string; and his address corresponded very well with his appearance. Never did that prim mouth give way before a laugh. A faint and misty smile was the widest departure from its propriety, and this unaccustomed disturbance made wrinkles in the flat, skinny cheeks like those in the surface of a lake, after the intrusion of a stone. ...

Still, lead poisoning is something you should be aware of, especially if you care for young children. Young children often put objects in their mouths, like toys, soil, hobby supplies, and paint chips, among other things. Any of these items may contain lead. In fact, until 1977 lead was a common ingredient in many indoor and outdoor house paints. If a child breathes dust from or eats bits of peeling lead paint, lead poisoning can result. It sometimes takes time for symptoms to present themselves, and lead poisoning can lead to mild learning disabilities or permanent mental and physical difficulties. The younger the child, the more damage lead poisoning can do. If you're concerned about a child in your life, talk to a doctor about a lead screening test.

According to the passage about lead poisoning, which of the following is true?

A.	All house paint made before 1977 contained lead.

Snow depth and light refraction have led to varying measurements. In the early 1950s, the Survey of India measured Mount Everest at 29,028 feet. But in 1975, a Chinese survey found the mountain to be about a foot taller at 29,029.24 feet. Then, in 1987, an Italian survey recorded a height of 29,108 feet -- an almost 80-foot increase over prior measurements. Using different methods, another Italian survey in 1992 found Mount Everest to be five feet shorter than the 1950s measurement -- calling all the measurements into question. In one of the last measurements, in 1999, a survey sponsored by the U.S. National Geographic Society and others used GPS equipment to determine that Mount Everest is 29,035 feet, plus or minus 6.5 feet, depending on snowcaps.

Ordering a veggie-filled salad may help you eat less of your entree, and by requesting your dressing on the side, you control how much dressing you eat. When it comes to your main dish, focus on steamed, grilled, or broiled entrees rather than items that are fried or pan-fried. Order a dish that includes vegetables, and avoid all-you-can-eat buffets. Reducing portion size also helps. You can do this by choosing an appetizer instead of an entree, and sharing an entree with a friend. Another way to reduce the amount you eat is to stop eating when you feel full and take the remainder of the meal home for another day.

The first time I went to an aquarium, I was startled to find the real-world companions to the scenes I'd imagined back then: a , its tendrils rising up two stories high and swaying gently around the gleaming, sinuous bodies of leopard sharks; blooms of jellyfish, some completely transparent, others vibrant, full of pulsating color; the colorful coral, guardians of the seahorses; and the arresting visions of an exhibit called ""the open sea"" where  tanks were home to glittering schools of Pacific sardines.

Brain-imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have shown that the brains of people who have depression look different than those of people without depression. The parts of the brain involved in mood, thinking, sleep, appetite, and behavior appear different. But these images do not reveal why the depression has occurred. They also cannot be used to diagnose depression.

In the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to

A.	warn the reader.

They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be. Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.

In describing Scrooge's experience of the room, the author's primary focus is on

A. 	Scrooge's tearful sadness.

If you have always been an honest person, you don't need to worry about what you've said to whom, or whether a dishonest statement you once made might result in additional deceits or even being caught in a lie. But the old saying, ""Honesty is the best policy,"" is perhaps not entirely accurate. As good a policy as honesty is, it's not really the best policy. There's something better -- integrity. A person of integrity is defined as one who unfalteringly adheres to a strict code of ethics or values; thus, integrity encompasses many characteristics, including being honest. Someone could honestly admit to being a thief, but a person of integrity, who believed it was wrong to steal or break the law, would not become a thief in the first place.

The main point of the passage is that

A.	thieves can be honest, but not have integrity.
B.	integrity is the same as honesty.
C.	all honest people have integrity.
D.	integrity is more than honesty.

It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life. I have, as it were, a superstitious hesitation in lifting the veil that clings about my childhood like a golden mist. The task of writing an autobiography is a difficult one. When I try to classify my earliest impressions, I find that fact and fancy look alike across the years that link the past with the present. The woman paints the child's experiences in her own fantasy. A few impressions stand out vividly from the first years of my life; but ""the shadows of the prison-house are on the rest."" Besides, many of the joys and sorrows of childhood have lost their poignancy; and many incidents of vital importance in my early education have been forgotten in the excitement of great discoveries.

They aspire to positively impact the greater good, and the greater good of their collective and individual people. Leaders realize that a unit is built up of individuals and they instill a sense of community and oneness so that the unit might operate successfully, effectively, and efficiently. Leaders understand that the unit requires the individual in order to function, and that the individual must benefit from the unit. The benefits may be improved finances, safety, or a sense of community. One thing that a leader isn't, is ""bad.""

Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness -- a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.

Originally a farm or semi-farm building, it followed the average New England colonial lines of the middle Eighteenth Century -- the prosperous peaked-roof sort, with two stories and dormerless attic, and with the Georgian doorway and interior panelling dictated by the progress of taste at that time. It faced south, with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street. Its construction, over a century and a half ago, had followed the grading and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity; for Benefit Street -- at first called Back Street -- was laid out as a lane winding amongst the graveyards of the first settlers….

About the year 1820 Nicephore Niepce made the discovery that bitumen, under certain conditions, was sensitive to light. He dissolved it in oil of lavender, and spread a thin layer of the solution thus obtained upon stone. This he exposed under a drawing (making the paper transparent by waxing), and after sufficient exposure, oil of lavender was poured on. Those portions of the bitumen which had been exposed to the action of the light had become insoluble, and so remained while the lines which had been protected by the drawing were dissolved away. By treating the stone with an acid these lines were bitten or eroded, and could be printed from. Niepce afterward employed metal plates instead of the stone.

For example, a goal to improve your health isn't specific enough, but a goal to run daily for improved health is. Goals also need to be measurable. Running to improve your health may entail running a particular distance. Achievable goals are important for success. Think of the impact of victories. Is running a marathon achievable if you have never completed a 5K race? Relevant goals support focus. If you are immersed in competitive swimming, a goal to run 5 miles daily may not be relevant since your energies are focused elsewhere. Useful goals have target dates; consider running a marathon by a specific, time-bound date. S.M.A.R.T goals are attainable; they are not unrealistic goals or goals lightly announced on New Year's Eve.

It's due to a property called shear thinning. Shear thinning liquids, which also include paint, nail polish, and whipped cream, can become thin and flow quickly after being shaken or stirred. Although shear thinning is common, scientists aren't sure why it occurs. It may be caused by interactions at the molecular level that are not well understood. Discovering more about the thickness or viscosity of a fluid would not only benefit ketchup lovers, but also help scientists and manufacturers who hope to use new liquids in their innovations.

There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants' cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches.

[T]he citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth's political clothes are worn out, and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he is a traitor.

Since the late 1970s, lower-fat ground and processed meat products were more heavily marketed, and consumers increased the consumption of poultry over red meats. In the mid-1980s meat producers began closer trimming of the solid, outside fat on retail cuts of meat. These factors notably lowered the contribution of meat, poultry, and fish to total fat (unsaturated, saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated) and saturated fat (solid at room temperature and tending to have a higher harmful cholesterol content) in the U.S. food supply. Despite near record-high per capita consumption of total meat in 1994, the proportion of fat in the U.S. food supply from meat, poultry, and fish declined from 32 percent in the 1950s to 25 percent in 1994.

This was one of the most anticipated stops on my vacation to the American Southwest last year. We (three others tourists and I) began our journey at 8:30 a.m. at Owl Canyon, residence of two majestic great horned owls. They were home, dozing off in one of the crevices, their feathers grey and blue in the cool morning light. Our guide, Josh, said that owls lived in this canyon for as long as he could remember -- always a pair -- but nobody has ever seen the owlets or could find the owls' nest. As we wandered deeper into the canyon, its smooth walls seemed to part before us and float up to the sky. It was so quiet -- the five of us were the only people there.

After quitting his job in 1919 to pursue a writing career, Fitzgerald began to author works that defined a generation and that have remained popular for decades. One of the most convincing arguments for calling Fitzgerald ""the voice of his generation"" is his continually studied and portrayed novel The Great Gatsby, which he wrote while living a life of extravagance thousands of miles from home in the French Mediterranean. The novel's characters embody the themes of the Roaring '20s. Fitzgerald's personal life seemed to follow the boom and bust of the Jazz Age. There is nearly universal agreement that Fitzgerald should be known as the voice of 1920s literature.

In the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to

A.	inform the reader.
B.	humor the reader.
C.	persuade the reader.
D.	entertain the reader.

The [police] force is composed largely of men of one nationality or of their descendants. A large majority affiliates with the same church. Prior to the passage of the civil service law in 1895, each biennial administration made the force its own valuable mine in which veins of rich rewards for its friends and political workers were found. To this force the aldermanic supporters of the administration attached their henchmen and ward heelers, and these, in turn, as public officers, looked after the political welfare of their backers and of the administration these backers supported. Thus, the political complexion of the force was liable to change every two years.

Based on the passage, the author's attitude towards the Chicago police force is best described as

A.	respectful.
B.	admiring.
C.	uneasy.
D.	neutral.

To get a hot air balloon up into the air, the balloon is first stretched out flat on the ground with the basket attached and on its side. Next, a fan blows air into the balloon. Then the burners are turned on, heating the air. The hot air rises, bringing the balloon and the basket upright. As hot air continues to be blown into the balloon, the balloon begins to rise. To steer it vertically, the pilot adjusts the burners, adding more heat to climb higher, or turning off the burners to let the air get cool so the balloon will descend. On average, a hot air balloon flight is about an hour.

According to the passage, in getting a hot air balloon off the ground, what should you do just before turning the burners on?

A.	Blow air into the balloon.
B.	Get the cooler air out of the balloon.
C.	Steer the balloon and basket upright.
D.	Stretch the balloon flat and affix the basket.

I've done it both ways and I think the best choice is to hire a professional moving company. Yes, it's cheaper to do it on your own, but you could end up hurting yourself, your furniture, or your friends -- and it usually takes longer. Caring for your injuries and spending more time can make the move even pricier than hiring help. If you hire movers, you'll pay more, but isn't it worth it not to have to bother your friends to help you? Also, when you hire professionals, you're more relaxed. Knowing you have movers whose job it is to make sure your possessions get safely where they need to be relieves some of the stress of moving.

Based on the passage, moving yourself might cost more time or money because of

A.	tending to your injuries.
B.	needing to persuade friends to help.
C.	the wait times for renting moving vans.
D.	the special equipment requirements for moving furniture.

Similar in shape to the Apollo capsule, which carried astronauts to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s, Orion is larger than Apollo and uses NASA's most advanced computing, electronics, and propulsion systems to date. Orion is designed to travel beyond low Earth orbit, so it will carry astronauts deeper into space than humans have ever been. Why not use the space shuttle that carried astronauts from 1981-2011 for this exploration further into our solar system? The space shuttle wasn't built to travel farther than low Earth orbit. It can't stay in space longer than two weeks and it can't withstand the high temperatures of a high-speed return. Orion, on the other hand, is built for trips in space lasting months. Thanks to new technology and the lessons of past missions, Orion is built to travel to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids.

According to the passage, which of the following is a similarity between Orion and the space shuttle?

A.	onboard computer system

The penguins of the Antarctic regions very rightly have been termed the true inhabitants of that country. The species is of great antiquity, fossil remains of their ancestors having been found, which showed that they flourished as far back as the Eocene epoch. To a degree far in advance of any other bird, the penguin has adapted itself to the sea as a means of livelihood, so that it rivals the very fishes. This proficiency in the water has been gained at the expense of its power of flight, but this is a matter of small moment, as it happens.

The famous actor, John Wayne, was born Marion Morrison and in his early films called himself Duke Wayne, based on a nickname from his youth. Wayne's first leading role and first appearance under the name John Wayne was in the 1930 feature film, The Big Trail. Unlike stars like Errol Flynn, Katherine Hepburn, and Clark Gable, John Wayne did not reach stardom early in his career, being cast in mostly minor roles in dozens of low-budget films from 1926-1938. Nevertheless, thanks to the director John Ford, who cast him in a starring role in the movie Stagecoach in 1939, John Wayne became a movie star. After Stagecoach, Wayne's stardom grew and by the end of World War II he was one of Hollywood's top-billed actors.

One of the most obvious ways to use less energy is to turn off unused lights. For lights you are using, there are several types of energy-efficient bulbs. You can save energy by learning which type of bulb best fits your needs. Using other simple tools and techniques can help you be more aware of efficiencies you might not be aware of. For example, there are websites available to assist in the planning and management of your electricity needs. There are wireless thermostats and power strips that can tell you how much energy you're using, and some of them allow you to turn off or change your settings when you're away from home. If you're short on money and time, however, start out small -- just turn out the lights before you leave your house.

According to the passage, light bulbs should be chosen based on

Ray had a collection of good stories. He was observant, truthful, and kindly -- perhaps the chief requisites in a good story-teller. Occasionally he used newspaper phrases, conscientiously learned in his efforts at self-instruction, but when he talked naturally he was always worth listening to. Never having had any schooling to speak of, he had, almost from the time he first ran away, tried to make good his loss. As a sheep-herder he had worried an old grammar to tatters, and read instructive books with the help of a pocket dictionary. By the light of many camp-fires he had pondered upon Prescott's histories, and the works of Washington Irving, which he bought at a high price from a book-agent. Mathematics and physics were easy for him, but general culture came hard, and he was determined to get it.

In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them.

You can often identify fraudulent products by watching for claims of curing a wide range of conditions or diseases. For example, a product that can regrow hair as well as diminish the appearance of scars is highly unlikely. Also, beware of personal testimonials; they're seldom authentic. Instead, look for scientific evidence backing up the claims the product makes. Anything that bills itself as an overnight remedy should make you suspicious, too. Few ailments are cured immediately. If identifying fraudulent products remains elusive, talk to a health care professional.

The commander of the ships, Captain Newport, sailed up the James River, found an area to settle, and called it Jamestown. Things went well at first. The colonists built small homes, cleared land for crops and, after an initial rocky start, became friendly with the inhabitants of the area. Soon after this early success, there were problems. During the summer and fall, thanks to disease, a contaminated water source, and poor hygiene, many colonists became ill and died. It soon became clear the colonists didn't have enough food to make it through the winter. Led by the Powhatan Nation's chief, members of the local tribe gave the colonists food, although by early 1608, only 35 of the original 105 had survived.

Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead her at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick laborer and prayed fervidly -- who had strange whims of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the application of her income which would interfere with political economy and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice before he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic life was, that opinions were not acted on.

For generations, chicken wings were either completely discarded or relegated to the heap of scrap meat, whose primary use was to provide flavor for stock. It wasn't until the 1960s that a chef named Teressa Bellisimo -- from Buffalo, New York -- came up with what some would argue was the most delicious idea of that decade: deep fry the wings and add hot sauce. Thus, the Buffalo wing took flight.

The first element is the prologue, which is a speech by either one or two actors that introduces the topic to the audience. The second part is the parode, or entrance ode, a chant by the play's chorus, who are just entering during this time. The third element of the play is the episodes, which usually number between three and five and unfold the narrative of the tragedy. Stasima, or stationary songs, are the fourth element. These are odes performed by the chorus, interspersed within the episodes, and used by the chorus to comment on and react to the goings-on in the tragedy. The exode, or the exit ode, is the fifth element and concluding ode performed by the chorus after the final episode.

And, as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts, it vanished with their sorrow.

For one thing, blood is something that cannot be manufactured and people in desperate need of blood can receive it only from those who are willing to give. Also, the donor's body naturally regenerates the blood; the donor doesn't actually lose anything. According to the American Red Cross, every two seconds someone in the United States is in need of blood. Giving a full pint only takes one hour or less, and doing so can save the lives of up to three patients. Blood donation may also benefit the donor.

Some believe that were it not for his defining act of betrayal, Arnold would be mentioned alongside the nation's great founding fathers and heroes. Before his defection, Arnold earned the nickname ""America's Hannibal,"" comparing him to one of history's greatest commanders. As a captain, Arnold helped to capture Fort Ticonderoga, a British garrison, in 1775. In 1776, he helped to ward off the British from taking New York at the Battle of Lake Champlain. Promoted to brigadier general in 1777, he was an indispensable figure in bringing about the surrender of the British army at Saratoga.

The 14th Amendment to the Constitution, written during the Reconstruction period, guaranteed that all male citizens would receive equal treatment under the law and not be deprived of their rights without due process. The First Reconstruction Act, passed in 1867, mandated that ex-Confederate states ratify the 14th Amendment to regain representation in Congress. This paved the way for the adoption of the 15th Amendment, which granted citizens the right to vote, regardless of their race, color, or prior status as slaves, to be adopted in 1870. However, because of widespread discrimination in some states, African Americans were not assured full voting rights until President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

Global supplies and prices, exchange rate changes, government agricultural support, and trade protection policies are factors affecting agricultural trade. With productivity of U.S. agriculture growing faster than domestic food and fiber demand, U.S. farmers and agricultural firms rely heavily on export markets to sustain prices and revenues. While producers rely on exports, consumers rely on imports. Historically, U.S. imports have increased steadily, as demand for diversification in food expands.

The building of railroads and hotels by the early 1900s facilitated travel to the place that became known officially in 1970 as the Sunshine State. Early interest in Florida was sparked by its natural beauty and unique outdoor and environmental offerings, such as sport fishing, steamboat tours on its rivers, and wildlife viewing in the Everglades. However, in the 1970s, the creation of large theme parks near Orlando brought a new kind of traveler and transformed the state's economy. Floridians quickly discovered a profitable market and continued to build upon and evolve its theme park empire. Tourism is a significant source of jobs for Floridians, and it continues to be an important source of revenue for the state.

The passage suggests that Florida tourism

A.	is beneficial to its residents.
B.	increased due to environmentalism.
C.	began because of newly built railways.
D.	is responsible for the state's nickname.

Though the three-branch structure is not required, Article IV of the Constitution mandates that states must govern in the form of a republic. One aspect of republicanism has been interpreted to mean that a state's executive cannot be more powerful than another branch within the state government. The executive of every state is a directly elected governor; however members of the executive branch, including the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, and the secretary of state, can either be directly elected or appointed by the governor. Though they reserve the right to organize their executive function in any way, states must balance power among the three branches of government in compliance with the republican Constitutional requirement.

According to the passage, which of the following is true regarding the structure of state governments within the U.S.?

A.	The specific formation is dictated by detailed federal guidelines.
B.	It can vary from state to state but must be in the form of a republic.
C.	The three-branch option is described in Article IV of the Constitution.
D.	It is intended to enhance the power of the directly elected executive branch.

A business plan should begin with an executive summary that summarizes the business's mission statement, possible market growth, market analysis, previous business experience, and projected business growth. Following the executive summary, a business plan should include a comprehensive overview of business elements such as a business description, potential products and services, market specifications, potential competition, operational methods, and sources of financial backing. The final component includes thorough financial projections that analyze historical financial data and prospective financial data that include forecasted income statements and cash flow statements. All financial projections should coincide with funding requests. Although starting a small business requires extensive planning, many proprietors prefer the freedom of self-employment.

According to the passage, an executive summary includes

A.	projected business growth.

There are stories told of players never changing their socks to keep a hitting streak alive, of never stepping on the foul lines when getting on and off the field, or of brushing their teeth after every inning. One of the most outrageous superstitions in baseball, however, is known as the curse of the billy goat. In Chicago, during the 1945 World Series between the Cubs and Tigers, a local tavern owner brought his pet goat to the stadium for good luck. Angry that his goat was kicked out, the tavern owner left, proclaiming that the Cubs would never win another World Series. The Cubs' subsequent bad luck in that World Series and in nearly every season for the next half-century has been attributed by some fans to this ""curse.""

The majority of her fiction, which she peopled with memorable characters drawn from her experiences, is set in her native Mississippi. Her characters are humorous, outrageous, slightly bizarre, but nonetheless appealing. She had a wonderful ear for dialogue, revealing character through individuals' use of everyday speech. Welty's interest in writing began in 1935 when she worked as a publicity agent for the Works Progress Administration, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program during the Great Depression. Traveling throughout the Deep South, Welty conducted interviews and photographed the lives of ordinary people, recording their hardship and misery. Her stunning images display her eye for detail and sense of compassion that would later permeate her fiction.

The author most likely wrote the passage to

A.	inform the reader about various literary awards.
B.	explain the effects of the Depression on people's lives.
C.	entertain the reader with a description of Welty's characters.
D.	persuade the reader to respect Welty's writing and photography.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends you gather emergency supplies, identify and reduce possible hazards in your home, and practice what to do during and after an earthquake, well in advance. Learning what actions to take can help you and your family to remain safe and healthy in the event of an earthquake. In most situations, you will reduce your chance of injury from falling objects (and even building collapse) if you immediately: Drop, Cover, Hold On. Do not stand in a doorway; you are safer under a table. In modern houses, doorways are no stronger than any other part of the house. The doorway does not protect you from the most likely source of injury -- falling or flying objects.

What is the author's main point?

A.	There are several options in preparing for an earthquake.
B.	Standing in a doorway during an earthquake will not keep you safe.
C.	Preparing and planning for an earthquake can help you survive one.

If possible within the few seconds before shaking intensifies, quickly move away from glass and hanging objects, bookcases, china cabinets, or other large furniture that could fall. If available nearby, grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and broken glass. If you are in the kitchen, quickly turn off the stove and take cover at the first sign of shaking. If you are in bed, hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow. You are less likely to be injured staying where you are. Broken glass on the floor has caused injury to those who have rolled to the floor or tried to get to doorways.

The time element as we know it does not exist in simple barter -- a man weaves a piece of cloth and exchanges it for a bushel of corn: time is of no account in the transaction. A small jobber located in the same territory as refiners buys a small amount of sugar today and distributes it to his trade the next -- time is negligible. A large jobber, buying perhaps for several branch houses, or located at points which necessitate a delay of two or three weeks in transit, may find it necessary even on a declining market to purchase a considerable amount of sugar, and, as a result, weeks may go by before his sugar arrives and is sold -- time is vitally important.

Which of the following can be concluded from the passage?

A.	Some forms of barter can take too long to be profitable.
B.	Large scale business transactions tend to take a longer amount of time.
C.	Buying a lot of sugar in a declining market is not a good business practice.

When young children -- who often differ in physical size, skill level, and family experience -- get together, patterns of hurtful behavior often emerge. Children may be mean to each other by making mean faces, saying threatening things, grabbing objects, pushing others aside, or refusing to play with others. Some young children may engage in actual bullying behaviors by deliberately and repeatedly dominating a vulnerable child by name-calling, physical attacks, and excluding others from playing with them. To prevent bullying from escalating, caregivers can prepare effective strategies to deal with bullying incidents -- before, during, and after they occur. They can also take steps to create an environment that supports respect, where bullying is not accepted or tolerated. Caregivers can also help children learn the social skills they need to deal with bullying when it occurs.

If you're interested in a particular product or service, trying before you buy might seem like a no-brainer. But what starts as a free trial, or a trial for a very low cost, can end up costing you real money. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, wants you to know that some companies use free trials to sign you up for more products, sometimes lots of products. This can cost you money, as they bill you every month until you cancel. Whether it's for a teeth whitener, vitamin or kitchen gadget, all free trials eventually end. And typically, if you don't want to buy what you've tried, you need to cancel or take some other action before the trial period is up.  If you don't, you may be agreeing to buy more products.

She read about a few widely advertised products that claimed to help with the process, but when she used them, found they were inefficient at best and not cost-effective. After trial and error, Emily discovered the easiest way to obtain shelled eggs consisted of six simple steps. First, boil the eggs until done. While the eggs are boiling prepare a bath of ice water. Once cooked, remove the eggs from the pan and immediately plunge them into the ice bath. Then gently crush the shells with your hands. Put the eggs to rest in cold water. After 15-20 minutes in the cold water, peel the eggs. Emily discovered that the ice-cold water drew the inside membrane away from the shell and the eggs, making them easy to peel.

According to the passage, the egg shells should be gently crushed immediately after which of the following steps?

A talented musician, she accompanied silent movies on the piano in the 1920s and wrote Spanish lyrics for popular songs. In 1930 she composed ""Huiracocha,"" a tribute to an Incan deity in the style of music from her homeland. As a copywriter for advertising agencies in the 1940s, she created jingles in Spanish and translated ads from English into Spanish for products to be sold in Latin America.

During the next century, traders from Portugal, the Netherlands, England, and Spain arrived, as did Jesuit, Dominican, and Franciscan missionaries. During the early 17th century, Japan's shogunate, or government leaders, suspected that the traders and missionaries were actually forerunners of a military conquest by European powers. This caused the shogunate to place foreigners under progressively tighter restrictions. Ultimately, Japan forced all foreigners to leave and barred relations with the outside world except for severely restricted commercial contacts with Dutch and Chinese merchants at Nagasaki. This isolation lasted for 200 years, until Commodore Perry of the U.S. Navy negotiated opening Japan to the West with the 1854 Kanagawa Convention.

Woodblock printing, a process in which characters are carved in reverse, inked, and pressed onto paper, first emerged in China during the Tang dynasty. A further development in printing occurred in the 11th century, when Bi Sheng fashioned movable type by carving single characters in clay; however, because of the sheer number of Chinese characters, printing with movable type was difficult. Movable type also proved to be more expensive than woodblock printing. Nonetheless, this technique eventually spread to Europe, possibly along the Silk Road trade routes. Though it is uncertain whether he was influenced by the Chinese antecedents, in the 15th century a German named Johann Gutenberg invented a printing press using movable type, making production of books faster and more efficient.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

Their perfectly adapted camouflage helps them blend in with their environment and avoid being seen by predators. If detected, however, they can leap five to six feet in a zigzag pattern to evade capture. Northern leopard frogs inhabit wet meadows and open fields near streams, ponds, and lakes. When on land, they breathe through their lungs, but they can also live underwater, absorbing oxygen through their skin. During breeding season, females deposit large masses of eggs in shallow water; tadpoles hatch in about a week. While tadpoles are herbivores, adults are carnivorous, commonly feeding on small invertebrates. Once numerous throughout much of North America, these unique frogs are unfortunately now in decline.

According to the passage, what function does the unusual coloring of the northern leopard frog serve?

Both similes and metaphors are figures of speech comparing things that are essentially dissimilar; however, similes are an explicit comparison using ""like"" or ""as,"" whereas metaphors are implied rather than stated directly. In declaring ""O, my love's like a red, red rose,"" Robert Burns is using a simile, while Robert Frost employs a metaphor when he likens the care employed in climbing tree branches to ""the same pains you use to fill a cup up to the brim, and even above the brim."" Another powerful figure of speech is personification, which attributes human characteristics to inanimate objects or abstract ideas. When Emily Dickinson states, ""We like March, his shoes are purple,"" she is personifying a particular month. If, like these poets, you employ figurative language, your writing will come alive.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

This view was challenged around 1020 AD by Islamic scientist and scholar Alhazen, who correctly concluded that vision is the product of rays of light entering the eyes from an outside source, rather than the other way around. As a result of the accumulated research of scientists and physicians over the following centuries, our understanding of vision has greatly expanded. Today, we know that vision begins when the retina absorbs light reflected off objects external to the eyes. Cells in the retina convert the light into electrochemical signals. The optic nerve then sends these signals to the brain, which decodes the information, creating an image.

In 1901, he embarked on his Blue Period, depicting melancholy themes rendered predominantly in blue, followed by his Rose Period, defined by a warmer palette and more cheerful themes. Then, with his provocative Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, completed in 1907, Picasso made a radical break with the past, abandoning conventional perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional plane. Breaking down human figures into fragments, he then recombined them on canvas, revealing his subjects from multiple perspectives.

Spot thought himself years older than the small boy; or at least he always acted so. If a goose hissed at little, toddling Johnnie Green, old Spot would drive the goose away, barking in a loud voice, ""Don't you frighten this child!""

Though many have attributed the creation of the telescope to him, Galileo only improved upon the invention. In 1608, Dutch lens makers used common eyeglass lenses to create a device that could see ""faraway things as though nearby."" This invention arranged convex and concave lenses in a tube, the combination of which magnified images up to four times. Galileo improved the design and was one of the first recorded to point it skyward. When he did, he observed mountains and craters on the moon, the phases of Venus, and that a band of thin light, later named the Milky Way, was composed of individual stars. He also discovered four Jupiter satellites. Using the telescope's images as evidence, Galileo battled against the accepted belief of his day that Earth was at the center of the heavens.

In anticipation of winter, red squirrels store great quantities of pine cones and nuts in and around the root systems of trees. As winter temperatures drop, more and more food must be consumed to compensate for the loss of body heat. What happens when the food stores run out before spring arrives? The industrious animal has adapted by harvesting maple syrup. With their teeth, they score the bark of the sugar maple tree, allowing sap to run out.

Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others. Health is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice as far as any improvement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday.

The tallest accurately measured sequoia standing in California, measures 325 feet, and there is no evidence that any other sequoia ever exceeded that height. Of late years, explorations in Victoria, Canada have brought to light a fallen eucalyptus tree measuring 435 feet from the roots to the top of the trunk. The trunk was 9 feet in circumference, and the height of the tree when growing was estimated to have been over 500 feet. Though the tree was dead, there is no doubt that it was far loftier than the tallest sequoia. Also in Victoria, there has recently been discovered an almond leaf gum measuring 380 feet from the ground to the first branch, and 450 feet to the topmost wing. This tree would overtop the tallest living sequoia by 125 feet. Though it has a smaller girth, it must be considered the tallest living tree in the world.

According to the passage, the tallest tree alive when the article was written was

A.	bigger around than a sequoia.
B.	a felled Canadian eucalyptus.
C.	taller than a sequoia by 125 feet.

NASA recognized that scientific advancement would eventually bring new investigative tools for future use. For instance, today's electron microscopes and other tools allow scientists to see in far greater detail than before, increasing the ability to detect smaller particles in the moon samples. Recent findings question the leading moon origin theory, in which a wandering planet-sized object crashed into the young Earth, propelling debris into space, where it coalesced into our moon. Comparison of lunar and terrestrial samples has shown that much of the moon's composition matches Earth's, rather than impactor material. Ongoing analysis may even indicate that Earth produced the moon without the aid of a second astronomical object.

This passage suggests that, many years after the Apollo missions to the moon

A.	scientists will continue to change their minds about moon rocks.

The boundaries of bodies are the least of all things. The proposition is proved to be true, because the boundary of a thing is a surface, which is not part of the body contained within that surface; nor is it part of the air surrounding that body, but is the medium interposted between the air and the body, as is proved in its place. But the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line forming the boundary of the surface, which line is of invisible thickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies with lines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature; for not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but their parts will be invisible from distance.

Solar storms can disable high-orbit satellites and can even induce high currents in power lines, knocking out power stations and transformers on Earth's surface. Our planet's magnetic field and atmosphere prevent most of the storms' particles and radiation from hitting our planet's surface and causing harm, but the moon and many other planetary bodies lack that protection. They are airless and generate no magnetic field. At speeds of up to a few million miles an hour, continuous streams of charged particles from these solar winds can slam into the unprotected surfaces of moons and asteroids, embed in them, and break off pieces in a process called space weathering. Solar storms accelerate space weathering on our solar system's airless planetary bodies.

The major emphasis of the passage is on

A.	the sun's explosive activity creating charged particles and radiation.
B.	how Earth is protected from solar winds because of its magnetic field.

Not as big, heavy, or bright as our sun, and about 63 light-years away, this orange dwarf is only a tiny pinpoint when seen through a telescope. In about 1.5 million years, however, Gliese 710 will be one of the brightest stars in the night sky. As it passes by at about one light-year from the sun, it will disturb the comets in our solar system. It will not have much direct impact on Earth, but it could have an extraordinary indirect effect, agitating and sending comets plunging in our direction. It is likely that some of those comets will hit Earth.

Despite being close relatives of the guinea pig, capybaras can grow up to four feet long and two feet tall, and can weigh up to 145 pounds. Their large size, along with their blunt snouts, led people to believe at one time that these rodents were a peculiar type of pig. In fact, the capybara's scientific name, Hydrochoerus, actually means ""water hog,"" which also describes their semiaquatic nature and their tendency to live near bodies of standing water, where they feed mostly on water plants. Because capybaras also like to eat melons, grain, squash, and other crop foods, many consider them to be agricultural pests.

This giant swarm of objects is now named the Oort Cloud, occupying space at a distance between 5,000 and 100,000 astronomical units. The outer extent of the Oort Cloud is believed to be in the region of space where the sun's gravitational influence is weaker than the influence of nearby stars. The Oort Cloud probably contains 0.1 to 2 trillion icy bodies in solar orbit. Occasionally, giant molecular clouds, stars passing nearby, or tidal interactions with the Milky Way's disc disturb the orbits of some of these bodies in the outer region of the Oort Cloud, causing the object to fall into the inner solar system as a so-called long-period comet. These comets have very large, eccentric orbits and take thousands of years to circle the sun.

Even though he took great care to brush daily, he only had one natural tooth left by the time he was inaugurated as the first president of the United States. Throughout his life, he consulted nine different dentists for a variety of issues, including infected and abscessed teeth, inflamed gums, as well as the need for better dentures, which never seemed to fit as comfortably as he wished. It wasn't until he consulted Dr. John Greenwood, a noted dentist of the day, that he was given a set of dentures he could actually tolerate.

Even though the Philippines was a Spanish colony for over 300 years, the cultural practices of several native groups remained largely uninterrupted by virtue of their geographical inaccessibility. The people known as the ""Igorots,"" for example, comprising about 10 different ethnic groups, resided in an extremely remote mountainous region on the island of Luzon. While most of the lowland inhabitants of Luzon gradually adopted Spanish customs, including speaking the Spanish language and practicing Christianity, the isolated Igorots maintained their own languages and native animistic beliefs. It wasn't until the mid-nineteenth century, after the country was recolonized by the United States in 1898 and was granted independence following World War II, that interaction increased between the Igorots and the lowland population. Much of this interaction, however, was due to disputes over valuable natural resources found in the mountains.

The attack continued for two days before the Union surrendered the fort, but not a single person was killed during the actual bombardment. Granted an honorable surrender by the Confederates, the Union planned a performance of a 100-gun salute to the United States flag, which would be lowered during the surrender ceremony. The 100-gun salute was stopped short, however, when a cannon discharged prematurely during the 47th round, causing several loose powder bags around the gun to explode.

As a result, rural areas gained the capacity to receive television programming that was not capable of being received by standard methods. With the development of television receive only (TVRO), broadcasters began to complain that their signals were either being received illegally or pirated. It was the position of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that users had as much right to receive satellite signals as broadcasters had the right to transmit them. The broadcasters, in response to this government policy, began to use technologies which allowed them to scramble the signals they were broadcasting.

Instead of detailing characters in socially stratified, realistic settings, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and other great U.S. novelists shaped heroic figures with nearly mythical statures. Their main characters were often haunted and doomed in ways that reflected the unknown workings of their own minds. In contrast, British novelists were situated in complex traditional societies, and their readers were offered a high level of detailed realism. During the same time, American authors faced a more tumultuous reality -- a history of strife and revolution, a relatively unknown frontier to the West, and a democratic society with very little in the way of social classes.

The work was so troubled by inadequate resources, poor equipment, and the lack of trained scientists, that Borlaug thought seriously about leaving the project. His new idea -- to shuttle wheat seeds to new locations where altitude and temperature differences would allow a second growing season -- ran afoul of conventional botanical wisdom. Risking his career and reputation, he pursued the new double season regimen by developing new strains with potential for quick and tangible outcomes.

The history of the U.S. House of Representatives is, in many ways, the history of America. It is a story of accomplishment, struggle, and compromise on the path to a more perfect union. In 1789, the House assembled for the first time in New York. It moved to Philadelphia in 1790 and then to Washington, DC, in 1800. In 1807, the House moved into the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, four years before the Capitol's House wing was fully completed. In 1814, the House and the nation were severely tested when invading British forces burned the Capitol. It would be another five years before the House's chambers were fully restored. In 1857, the House met for the first time in its present-day chambers.

According to the passage, in what year was the House of Representatives first located in Washington, D.C.?

A.	1789
B.	1790

Our second day's cruise about the Puget Sound took us past historic grounds. We went by old Fort Nisqually, one of the earliest posts of the Hudson's Bay Company on Puget Sound. Some houses had been built on the spot in 1829 or 1830, though the fort, one fourth of a mile back from water, was not constructed until 1833, just twenty years before our visit. As the tide and wind favored us, we did not stop. Soon we came in sight of a fleet of seven vessels lying at anchor in a large bay, several miles in extent. The sight of those seven vessels lying in the offing made a profound impression upon our minds.

According to the passage, the authors were most moved when they saw

A. 	Puget Sound.

After attending school, he apprenticed on a sea ship and, after only four years, captained his first vessel -- a trading ship that sailed between England and the West Indies. In 1775, Jones moved to Philadelphia and received a Continental Navy appointment. Though Jones fought in many battles during the Revolutionary War, he is celebrated for a victory born out of a refusal to admit defeat. As his ship was sinking, he was asked by the commander of the enemy vessel if he wanted to surrender. Jones is said to have famously replied, ""I have not yet begun to fight!"" Though the ship did sink, Jones managed to first win the battle. He went on to live in France after the war, but Jones always considered himself an American and is buried at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

Based on the passage, Jones is best known for a battle he won due to his

A.	naval skills during war.

Hunter-gatherers, surviving on wild game and wild plants, first occupied the area from approximately 6000 BC to 500 AD. By approximately 300 BC, people labeled ""Basketmakers"" by archaeologists begin practicing cultivation of simple plants such as corn and squash in the region. During the Formative Period, which lasted from 500 to 1300 AD, the region was peopled by the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont. These peoples relied more and more on growing their food and even developed ways to store food for later use and for trade. Nomadic Numic language speakers, such as the Southern Paiute and the Utes, inhabited the area from about 1100 until the late 1700s. Future research by historians and archaeologists will likely continue to shed light on these early civilizations.

Since the early 17th Century fortifications and other defenses had been built to protect the area, but it wasn't until the War of 1812 against Great Britain that the U.S. realized just how deficient those defenses were. The capture and burning of Washington, D.C. during those hostilities was the price the U.S. paid for leaving the Chesapeake Bay and its Atlantic coastline under-defended. After the war, President Monroe and Congress created a plan to protect coastal cities with a ""Third System"" of fortifications. Construction of Fort Monroe, the first and largest of these, began in 1819 and concluded in 1834. Its mission to protect Hampton Roads was accomplished by building one of the most powerful artilleries of the time.

He put his foot on it, and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth, and chewed and chewed at it, gradually taking it in, and all the while opening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy, as if he had never tasted anything as good as an overcoat before, in his life.

Then, in 1636, the Dutch acquired the island, though Britain took control of it for a period of time during the Napoleonic Wars. Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in the 1980s and became a separate, autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. When this occurred, the small island gained full autonomy in its internal affairs and the Dutch government became responsible for its defense and foreign affairs. Full independence was a possibility for Aruba in 1990; however, the island decided against it.

According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), during the first missions to space, astronauts used mechanical pencils because ink pens could not function in low gravity conditions. In 1965, this caused controversy when the American public found out these pencils cost about $130 each. During the same time as the controversy, Paul C. Fisher had an idea to design a ballpoint pen that could work in space. Spending a reported $1 million of his company's money, he engineered the space pen. Not only could Fisher's pen perform well in a weightless environment, it could also work underwater, and in extremely high and low temperatures. Due to the mechanical pencil controversy, NASA was hesitant at first, but eventually purchased Fisher's space pens for space missions.

They generally enter the U.S. by both intentional and unintentional human activity. For example, these invaders can be carried into the U.S. by cargo ships or a traveler's luggage. Once here, they spread through simple, everyday activities such as moving firewood from one area to another or by planting invasive species in a backyard garden. How can we stop the invasion of these aliens and the damage they cause? There are many ways. For example, we can learn to identify invasive species and remove them from our gardens. We can clean equipment and gear that have been used in an area infested with these invaders. And, if returning from international travel, we can declare animal products, plants, and food to an airport agent to make sure we are not bringing in invasive species, pests, or diseases.

Some tips entail no or little cost and can be used daily to increase your energy savings, while others require a larger investment for long-term savings. One of the cheapest ways to be more efficient is to use sunlight to your advantage. The sun's rays can contribute heating in the winter but force air conditioners and fans to work harder -- and use more energy -- in the summer. During winter months, you can take advantage of sunlight by opening your curtains during the day to allow the sun to heat your home naturally. During warmer months, use light-colored window shades or blinds to reflect heat back outside, keeping your home cooler and more efficient. Additionally, using natural lighting effectively will also reduce the need to use artificial light.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	argue that the best way to save is by using sunlight more effectively.
B.	demonstrate that not all energy efficiencies are expensive.
C.	introduce homeowners to the many uses of solar energy.

After determining there is no patent, you must then establish what type of patent you need. There are three types of patents: utility, design, and plant. A utility patent is the most common and is for any new and useful process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter. These patents are also given to inventors who devise any new and useful improvement on something that has already been patented. Design patents are for any new and nonobvious ornamental design; while plant patents are granted for the invention or discovery of any distinct and new variety of plant that can be reproduced. After determining which type of patent you need, you're ready for step four, deciding on your filing strategy.

She was for many years the architect and author of the movement's most important events, including the first women's rights convention. Stanton was introduced to reform movements as a young woman when she encountered fugitive slaves at the home of her cousin Gerrit Smith. It was at Smith's home that she also met her husband Henry Stanton. Soon after their marriage in 1840 they traveled to London, where Henry was a delegate to the World Anti-Slavery Convention. There she met Lucretia Mott, the Quaker teacher who served in many of the anti-slavery and women's rights organizations with which Stanton was subsequently associated. Denied a seat at the convention, as were all the women delegates, Mott discussed with Stanton the need for a convention on women's rights.

He doesn't jeer at things, not because he hasn't the wit, but as though he hadn't time to waste on such trifles. He never listens to what is said to him.

And here permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, ""a long poem,"" is simply a flat contradiction in terms. I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all cannot be sustained throughout a composition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it flags -- fails -- a revulsion ensues -- and then the poem is, in effect, and in fact, no longer such.

How much easier it is, when you want to play a Game, to find  Player than twenty-two. At the same time, though one Player is enough, a good deal more amusement may be got by two working at it together, and correcting each other's mistakes.

The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts was established in 1910 to meet the growing need for a permanent body to advise the government on matters pertaining to the arts; and particularly, to guide the architectural development of Washington. Legislation for the creation of the Commission was approved on May 17, 1910. Initially, the Commission was authorized to advise on the location of statues, fountains, and monuments in public areas in the District of Columbia. On October 25, 1910, President Taft issued an executive order authorizing the Commission to advise on plans for public buildings erected by the federal government within the District of Columbia. Subsequent legislation extended the Commission's authority to regulate the height, exterior design and construction of private and semi-public buildings in designated historic areas.

Search and Rescue (SAR) is one of the U.S. Coast Guard's oldest missions. Minimizing injury, property damage, and the loss of life by rendering aid in the maritime environment has always been a Coast Guard priority. SAR response involves multi-mission stations, cutters, aircraft and boats linked by communications networks. The National SAR Plan divides the U.S. area of SAR responsibility into internationally recognized inland and maritime regions. The Coast Guard is the Maritime SAR Coordinator. To meet this responsibility, the Coast Guard maintains SAR facilities on the East, West, and Gulf coasts; in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico, as well as on the Great Lakes and inland U.S. waterways. The Coast Guard is recognized worldwide as a leader in the field.

Based on the passage, the National SAR Plan separates search and rescue tasks according to which of the following?

The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), signed into law in 2011, enables the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better protect public health by strengthening the food safety system. It enables the FDA to focus more on preventing rather than reacting to problems after they occur. The legislation significantly enhances the FDA's ability to oversee the millions of food products that come into the United States from other countries each year. An estimated 15 percent of the U.S. food supply is imported, including 60 percent of fresh fruits and vegetables and 80 percent of seafood. The law gives the FDA new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods.

The major emphasis of the passage is on how

A.	foodborne diseases cause illness in the U.S.
B.	the FDA has gained control over food imports. 
C.	the FSMA strengthens the FDA's oversight of imports.
D.	imported foods are more dangerous than domestic foods.

If I must tell more tales of Raffles, I can but back to our earliest days together, and fill in the blanks left by discretion in existing annals. In so doing I may indeed fill some small part of an infinitely greater blank, across which you may conceive me to have stretched my canvas for the first frank portrait of my friend. The whole truth cannot harm him now. I shall paint in every wart. Raffles was a villain, when all is written; it is no service to his memory to glaze the fact; yet I have done so myself before today. I have omitted whole heinous episodes. I have dwelt unduly on the redeeming side. And this I may do again, blinded even as I write by the gallant glamour that made my villain more to me than any hero. But at least there shall be no more reservations, and as an earnest I shall make no further secret of the greatest wrong that even Raffles ever did me.

The rabbit lived with his grandmother, who needed a new dress. ""I will go out and trap an elk for you so you shall have a new dress with its skin,"" he said. When he went out he laid down his bow in the path while searching for his snares. An elk coming by saw the bow. ""I will play a joke on the rabbit,"" he said. ""I will make him think I have been caught."" He then put one foot on the string and lay down as if dead. Later the rabbit returned. When he saw the elk he ran home crying: ""Grandmother, I have trapped an elk. You shall have a new dress. Throw the old one in the fire!"" This the grandmother did. The elk now sprang to his feet laughing. ""Ho, friend rabbit,"" he called, ""You thought to trap me; now I have mocked you."" And he ran away into the thicket. The rabbit who had come back to skin the elk now ran home again. ""Grandmother, don't throw your dress in the fire,"" he cried. But it was too late. The old dress was burned.

It suddenly came into Katharine's mind that if someone opened the door at this moment he would think that they were enjoying themselves; he would think, ""What an extremely nice house to come into!"" and instinctively she laughed, and said something to increase the noise, for the credit of the house presumably, since she herself had not been feeling exhilarated. At the very same moment, rather to her amusement, the door was flung open, and a young man entered the room.

It would be as right to express, in the same foolish comparison, the worth of the Pleiades. That pinch of star dust, the Pleiades, exquisitely remote in deepest night, where light all but fails, has not the power of a sulfur match; yet, it brings into distinction those distant and difficult hints -- hidden far behind all our verified thoughts -- which we rarely properly view. So the star-like candle for me. No other light follows so intimately an author's most ghostly suggestion. We sit, the candle and I, in the midst of the shades we are conquering, and sometimes look up from the lucent page to contemplate the dark hosts of the enemy with a smile before they overwhelm us; as they will, of course.

Niagara means nothing. It is not leading anywhere. It does not result from anything. It throws no light on the effects of Protection, nor on the Facility for Divorce in America, nor on Corruption in Public Life, nor on Canadian character, nor even on the Navy Bill. It is merely a great deal of water falling over some cliffs. But it is very remarkably that. The human race, apt as a child to destroy what it admires, has done its best to surround the Falls with every distraction, incongruity, and vulgarity. Hotels, powerhouses, bridges, trams, picture post-cards, sham legends, stalls, booths, rifle-galleries, and side-shows frame them about. And in the midst of all this, overwhelming it all, are the Falls. One who sees them instantly forgets humanity. They are not very high, but they are overpowering.

According to the passage, experiencing Niagara Falls is

A.	so extraordinary that one forgets the intrusive tourist attractions.
B.	so powerful that one must spend at least a day there to take it in.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that approximately 15 percent of Americans between the ages of 20 and 69 have high-frequency hearing loss due to exposure to loud sounds at work or in leisure activities. Hearing loss can occur with a single loud noise or prolonged exposure to sounds with high decibel (dB) levels. The louder the noise is, the higher its decibel level. Sounds at and above 85 dB can cause permanent hearing loss. Examples of high-decibel noises are firearms and jet engines (140 dB), a jackhammer (130 dB), and sirens (120 dB). Even some personal music players can reach 110 decibels. You can protect yourself from these and other high-decibel noises by avoiding loud noises altogether and using hearing protection, such as earplugs and earmuffs.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	Young Americans are particularly susceptible to hearing loss.
B.	It is likely that people will have hearing loss from listening to loud music.

Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness. Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the somber facts of death and burial. She touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial. She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature introspective to a high degree. Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope; the first red leaf hurrying through ""the altered air,"" an epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or melancholy, she lived in its presence.

The author describes Dickinson largely in terms of the poet's

A.	senses and emotions.
B.	manners and conduct.
C.	ideas and perceptions.

It was difficult for me to memorize and, subsequently, I didn't like it very much nor did I care to understand what it meant. Years later, grown up and with teenagers of my own, I was in my backyard talking to my neighbor over the fence that was in need of repair. Neither my neighbor nor I were the original owners of our houses, and we didn't know who owned the fence or who would pay to fix it. As we were about to argue, that obnoxious poem forced on me in youth elbowed its way into my memory! What's more, I finally understood it. It was about two people perpetually attempting to repair an unfixable fence. I stopped myself from fighting with my neighbor and asked him if we needed the fence at all. I invited him to discuss the matter over dinner. Walking back to the house, Frost's poem was running through my mind as if I had memorized it yesterday.

In the time of Spanish rule, and for many years afterwards, the town of Sulaco … had never been commercially anything more important than a coasting port with a fairly large local trade in ox-hides and indigo. The clumsy deep-sea galleons of the conquerors that, needing a brisk gale to move at all, would lie becalmed, where your modern ship built on clipper lines forges ahead by the mere flapping of her sails, had been barred out of Sulaco by the prevailing calms of its vast gulf. Some harbors of the earth are made difficult of access by the treachery of sunken rocks and the tempests of their shores.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, avian influenza (AI), or ""bird flu,"" is a type of virus that infects domestic poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, quail, geese, and wild birds, such as shorebirds and waterfowl. AI viruses are divided into two groups -- highly pathogenic (HPAI) and low pathogenic (LPAI) -- based on the ability of the virus to produce disease and the severity of illness it can cause. HPAI spreads rapidly and has a high death rate in birds. LPAI causes only minor illness and occurs naturally in migratory waterfowl. The concern is that some LPAI virus strains are capable of mutating into HPAI viruses. HPAI viruses are considered exotic or foreign to the United States because they do not occur naturally here. HPAI has been detected in the U.S. three times: 1924, 1983, and 2004.

""I have been"" he wrote, ""one acquainted with the night."" And because he knew the midnight as well as the high noon, because he understood the ordeal as well as the triumph of the human spirit, he gave his age strength with which to overcome despair.

Though Earth Day occurs just once a year, every day is Earth Day at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA's Earth Science Mission seeks to understand Earth's systems and their responses to natural and anthropogenic (human-made) changes. A fleet of satellites in NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) gives scientists the global, long-term measurements they need to connect the atmosphere (air), lithosphere (land), hydrosphere (water), cryosphere (snow/ice), and biosphere (life) as a single system. Each of these satellites gathers a unique set of measurements for studying Earth. These measurements are used to improve weather forecasts, understand natural disasters, manage agriculture and forests, and predict how climate will change.

Based on the passage, NASA's EOS is in place primarily to

A.	survey solar systems.
B.	deploy a satellite fleet.
C.	measure Earth systems.
D.	prevent natural disasters.

I had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William Robinson, a Cornish man, commander of the Hopewell came to my house. I had formerly been surgeon of another ship where he was master, and a fourth part owner, in a voyage to the Levant. He had always treated me more like a brother, than an inferior officer; and, hearing of my arrival, made me a visit …. expressing his joy to find me in good health, asking, ""whether I were now settled for life?"" adding, ""that he intended a voyage to the East Indies in two months,"" at last he plainly invited me, though with some apologies, to be surgeon of the ship; ""that I should have another surgeon under me, beside our two mates; that my salary should be double to the usual pay; and that having experienced my knowledge in sea-affairs to be at least equal to his, he would enter into any engagement to follow my advice, as much as if I had shared in the command.

What was the relationship of the narrator to Captain Robinson while at sea?

We got six thousand dollars apiece -- all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied.

People began to find out in the last century that thoughts -- just mere thoughts -- are as powerful as electric batteries -- as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison. So long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child. Circumstances, however, were very kind to her, though she was not at all aware of it. They began to push her about for her own good. When her mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day, there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts, which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow.

The passage suggests that Mary's new thoughts were

For fires involving wood, paper, cloth, or trash -- class A fires -- extinguishing fire with water is fine. But for class B fires, those involving flammable liquids such as gas, grease, oil, or paint, water is dangerous. Water is also not a remedy for class C fires that arise from charged electrical equipment. When combustible metals are burning, the fire is designated as class D. Water extinguishers are to douse class A fires only. Foam extinguishers are appropriate to fight class A and B fires. Carbon dioxide (CO2) extinguishers are used for classes A, B, and C fires. Dry powder extinguishers can be safely used on Class A, B, C, and D fires.

The use of a mnemonic, or memory aid, can help. For example, procedures for using a fire extinguisher are easy if you just remember the mnemonic P-A-S-S. Each letter is a cue for what you are supposed to do in a specific order. First, pull the pin from the lever handle. With the pin in place, the lever handle cannot be compressed to release the extinguishing agent. Second, aim the nozzle, located at the end of the hose, toward the base of the fire. Third, squeeze the lever steadily. And finally, sweep the nozzle from one side of the fire to the other side of the fire. Understand how to use your extinguisher before you have the need to use it. If you have a hard time remembering how to use it, remember PASS.

According to the passage, mnemonics are aids for

A.	memory.
B.	learning.
C.	PASS.

0422.	To maintain safety and prevent collisions at sea, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security publishes 38 basic rules that govern the use of navigable waters, whether inland or international. Included are rules governing conduct of vessels and types of signals. Conduct of vessels determines who does what and when they do it. If two vessels are going to cross paths, both captains need to know what is expected of them and what is expected of the other vessel. In such a scenario, the ""give-way vessel"" is the one that should change course; the ""stand-on vessel"" is the one that always maintains its course. For example, when a powered vessel encounters a sailing vessel, the powered one is always obligated to give way to the sailing vessel because of the sailing vessel's more limited ability to maneuver.

Based on the passage, which type of vessel always has the right-of-way?

A	stand-on

Each light has a specific and important meaning, and each color has a specific, regulated purpose. The light on the vessel's left side --- the port side -- is always red. Port side doesn't mean the vessel's left side as you would see it from the shore; rather, port side means your own left side as a passenger on the ship facing the bow. The bow is the front of the ship. The light on the starboard side -- your right side -- is always green. These lights are required to be viewable from the front and each side of the vessel. The light placed at the highest point of the vessel, which must be observable from the front, back, and both sides, is always white.

0425.	Meteorologists, those people who study and predict the weather, use data gathered from satellites, aircraft, ships, and balloons all around the globe to develop weather forecasts. Over the years, numerous approaches to weather prediction have been developed, but one of the most reliable methods is called Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). It relies on complex computer programs to predict how temperature, air pressure, wind, and rainfall will interact in producing weather. However, because we don't always have complete data from places like mountains or oceans, the NWP method is not completely reliable; gaps in data may and often do create errors in predictions. Besides that, it takes human knowledge and experience to interpret computer forecasts, and beginners are not always accurate.

According to the passage, NWP is reliable as long as

A.	weather forecasters are computer literate.

Just as locations on Earth are defined in terms of longitude and latitude, the locations of stars are defined in terms of celestial coordinates called right ascension and declination. The celestial equivalent of longitude, right ascension is measured in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds. Declination, the equivalent of latitude, is measured in terms of degrees from the celestial equator. If you think of Earth's equator as a ring, the celestial equator is just a much larger version of that ring out in space. And just as Earth has north and south poles, the celestial sphere has north and south poles, too. This system for defining the positions of stars works with almost absolute accuracy.

I have often observed some surprise expressed by visitors at a large cat-show on seeing an assemblage of so many different sorts of cats. Our common favorites, the tabby cats, are the handsomest and the best. The Brown Tabby is a deep, rich brown grey. The Blue or Silver Tabby is a pale variety of tabby, which is sometimes beautiful. The ground-color is a silver grey, with the stripes of a darker shade. In bold contrast with the blue, the Red Tabby is of a bright sandy yellow, with the usual markings of a deeper shade. Some of these cats are of very good color, so much so as to be distinguished by their proud owners under the very aspiring title of ""Orange Tabby."" Spotted Tabby cats are distinguished from the others by having markings that are broken up into small, well-defined spots, being more or less elongated upon the sides, transversely to the stripes along the back.

0428.	Many wildland fires are a natural part of Earth's ecological processes. Fires that burn in non-populated areas can be beneficial to the local ecosystem. Fires burn fallen trees, limbs, leaves, and needles on the forest floor, which in turn nourishes the soil. When fires destroy low brush and younger trees, established trees have less competition for nutrients and sunlight, so they grow stronger and taller. Some trees require intense heat to propagate; their cones release seeds after being exposed to the heat of a fire. When thick brush is burned, new, tender shoots grow. This new growth offers both food and homes to many wildlife animals. The term ""prescribed natural fire"" is used to describe a wildfire that is not threatening humans or property and that is controllable based on conditions and resources. To promote growth and healthy forests, these fires are allowed to burn without human intervention. 

Based on the passage, an advantage of wildland fires is that they

A.	control animal populations.
B.	encourage wildlife to migrate.
C.	enable cones to release seeds.

Their faces have resided together, sculpted into the side of Mount Rushmore, since 1941. The sculptor who directed this ambitious project was Gutzon Borglum, and he oversaw its creation for fourteen years. Each president was memorialized, in part, for a particular contribution to the United States: Washington because he led the colonists to victory in the American Revolution, Jefferson because he acquired the Louisiana Territory from France, Lincoln because he worked to preserve the Union and free the slaves, and Roosevelt because he advanced the construction of the Panama Canal.

Jump from a plane at 10,000 to 14,000 feet high, and you'll free fall at 110 mph for up to an entire minute or more. During that time, you'll find you can move your body in any direction: stand on your head, stand on your feet, or glide like an eagle. When the parachute opens, and you begin to descend more slowly, time seems to stand still. The most daring (and some might argue, frightening) part -- the jump -- is over, and everywhere you look, you see the vast world as you have never seen it. Fears give way to a sense of awe at the beauty of the earth, to which you gently return. The unforgettable view makes the adventure of skydiving feel entirely worth the risk.

Based on the passage, the author's attitude toward skydiving is most likely that it

As a Major General during the War of 1812, Jackson displayed great leadership when, after receiving orders to immediately disband his militia, he refused to leave his soldiers to find their own ways home. He walked alongside them up from New Orleans to Tennessee, aiding the sick, encouraging the weak, and ensuring enough food and supplies for the journey. In tribute, Jackson's soldiers nicknamed him ""Old Hickory"" for his strength, determination, and loyalty. His strength didn't seem to fade over time. In 1835, when Jackson was 67 years old, he became the first president against whom an assassination was attempted. Jackson survived the attempt of the gun-wielding assassin by hitting him over the head repeatedly with his cane.

It is now nearly forty years since I assisted my late father, Charles Upham, in the preparation of his work on Salem Village and the Witchcraft tragedy of 1692, by collecting what information could be obtained from the records as to the people and their homes. In doing this I was enabled to construct a map showing the bounds of the grants and farms at that time. On that map is represented quite accurately the Downing Farm, owned, in 1638, by Emanuel Downing, and occupied as tenant, in 1692, by John Procter, the victim of the witchcraft delusion. When I made the map I knew that John Procter at his death owned fifteen acres of land in Salem…. Lately, in making a more complete study of the records I have learned the exact situation of the lot owned by him, and also that he had a house upon it until his death in 1692. It appears that this lot is the place where he was buried, according to the family tradition.

In fact, lawyers back then used the defense ""guilty by reason of the full moon"" in an attempt to exonerate their criminal clients. Today, some still believe that the moon affects people and even causes sprees of violent crimes and psychotic behavior. One theory states that the gravitational pull of the moon -- which is stronger when it's full -- can ""control"" the human body as it does the ocean's tides because the body is mostly composed of water.

The ""Genovese Syndrome,"" also known as the ""bystander effect,"" refers to a social phenomenon in which the more people who are witness to an emergency, the less likely it is that any of them will intervene. The phenomenon was named after a person who, in 1964, was killed in the middle of an apartment complex. Surrounded by dozens of apartments, the murder reportedly occurred in the presence of 38 people watching from their windows. Reports of this incident, however, were likely exaggerated, painting the many witnesses as indifferent and uncaring. The truth is, many of these ""eyewitnesses"" did not see the murder at all and only heard faint screams they thought were the typical noises of a nearby bar. Several called the police. Others were simply half-asleep and confused -- the incident happened at night -- rather than unconcerned.

The gold attracted hundreds of thousands of people from other states and all around the world. By the mid-1850s, there were well over 300,000 new settlers in California, all in search of gold. About 25 percent of that population was born outside of the United States. Unfortunately, the majority of these gold miners never made it rich and, in fact, those who profited most were the entrepreneurs who settled in California to provide services and merchandise for all the gold-seekers.

The principle of the sovereignty of the people is not either barren or concealed, as it is with some other nations; it is recognized by the customs and proclaimed by the laws; it spreads freely, and arrives without impediment at its most remote consequences.

One of the most infamous literary forgeries of all time was conducted by William-Henry Ireland, who in 1796 penned a play titled Vortigern and Rowena, claiming it to be a lost work by William Shakespeare. Ireland's motivation for creating the forgery was the desire to impress his emotionally distant father. Although some perceived the writing as weak, the forgery proved good enough, however, for a London theater company to decide to stage the play. Theatergoers were excited to witness such a historical production but left bitterly disappointed; the weaknesses inherent in the play's script were enhanced on the stage. The production was met with ridicule and, after its first and only performance, was cancelled. Afterwards, William-Henry proudly confessed his forgery, and yet his father refused to believe him -- but not for reasons that pleased him: his father said he was too dull to pull off such an elaborate hoax.

Which of the following statements about William-Henry Ireland is suggested by the passage?

A.	He knew his father was not easily fooled.
B.	He went to great lengths to impress his father.

These articles were, of course, presented to the public as fact. The driving force behind yellow journalism was commercial. The outrageous headlines would grab people's attention and more copies of the newspaper would be sold. Some believe that yellow journalism played a major role in provoking the Spanish-American War, often referred to as the first ""media war."" In fact, early on, when reporters of The New York Journal went to Cuba and found that nothing much was happening, their editor William Randolph Hearst famously told them: ""You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war."" Hearst was also responsible for placing blame on the Spanish for the sinking of the USS Maine, though the actual cause of its explosion is still unknown. Two months later, the war broke out.

Which of the following statements about yellow journalism is suggested by the passage?

A.	It was the driving force behind most of the wars after the 1890s.

The highlight of the collection is 82 copies of the First Folio, published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare died. This was the first time many of his great plays such as Macbeth, As You Like It, and Julius Caesar appeared in print. Only 232 of the 500 copies of the First Folio are still in existence. One of these is on permanent display at the Folger, and guests can ""flip through"" the document on a touchscreen monitor. This First Folio can also be viewed on the Folger Shakespeare Library website, where a Second Folio, published in 1632, is also on display, along with several ""quartos"" that the Folger collection includes. Quartos were relatively low-quality publications of individual plays, most of which were published during Shakespeare's lifetime.

In the old days, when the world was young, there were no automobiles nor flying-machines to make one wonder; nor were there railway trains, nor telephones, nor mechanical inventions of any sort to keep people keyed up to a high pitch of excitement. Men and women lived simply and quietly. They were Nature's children, and breathed fresh air into their lungs instead of smoke and coal gas; and tramped through green meadows and deep forests instead of riding in street cars; and went to bed when it grew dark and rose with the sun -- which is vastly different from the present custom. Having no books to read they told their adventures to one another and to their little ones; and the stories were handed down from generation to generation and reverently believed.

Based on the passage, the view of the author is most likely that children of old

A.	were more trusting because they didn't read.

Hermann was the son of a German who had become a naturalized Russian, and from whom he had inherited a small capital. Being firmly convinced of the necessity of preserving his independence, Hermann did not touch his private income, but lived on his pay, without allowing himself the slightest luxury. Moreover, he was reserved and ambitious, and his companions rarely had an opportunity of making merry at the expense of his extreme parsimony. He had strong passions and an ardent imagination, but his firmness of disposition preserved him from the ordinary errors of young men. Thus, though a gamester at heart, he never touched a card, for he considered his position did not allow him -- as he said -- ""to risk the necessary in the hope of winning the superfluous,"" yet he would sit for nights together at the card table and follow with feverish anxiety the different turns of the game.

In describing Hermann, the author's primary focus is on

He prescribed me the usual sudorific … and then was getting up to go home, but somehow fell into talk and remained. I was exhausted with feverishness; I foresaw a sleepless night, and was glad of a chat with a pleasant companion. He began to converse freely. He was a sensible fellow, and expressed himself with vigor and some humor. Queer things happen in the world: you may live a long while with some people, and be on friendly terms with them, and never once speak openly with them from your soul; with others you have scarcely time to get acquainted, and all at once you are pouring out to him -- or he to you -- all your secrets, as though you were at confession.

Characterized by massive sandstone buttresses, high plateaus, waterfalls, deep valleys, and rock towers resembling huge, mysterious cathedrals, these mountains are as beautiful as they are difficult to climb. Eons ago, geologists believe, the granite foundation upon which these mountains stand was covered by a vast lake. Over millions of years, runoff filled the lake with layers of sand and mud that hardened into stone under the pressure of compacting weight. Then, more recently -- about 160 million years ago -- as Earth's slowly drifting tectonic plates began splitting this land apart, molten lava poured out through cracks in the earth's crust. Thanks to erosion, layers of ancient stone are now exposed to mountain climbers who find the Drakensberg's challenges irresistible.

In discussing the Drakensberg, the author's primary focus is on

After studying art in The Hague and in Antwerp, he moved to Paris where his brother Theo supported him. After a time, he moved to the south of France, where he felt the sun, warm weather, and bright colors would inspire him. There, Vincent worked feverishly, completing hundreds of paintings. But by the end of 1889, after only a decade of work, he suffered a breakdown and committed himself to a sanitarium.

Having grown up on a small farm, Lincoln was an advocate for farms and farmers long before he became president. While in office, Lincoln signed a law establishing the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He also approved the Homestead Act, which allowed willing individuals to settle 160 acres of land in the West in exchange for the title to that land. He also signed an act that set the stage for completing a rail connection between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to facilitate westward movement. By signing the Morrill Land Grant College Act, which, among other things, granted land to states to establish colleges and universities specializing in ""agricultural and the mechanic arts,"" he demonstrated his belief in the importance of educating farmers and those without access to higher education. With these landmark achievements, Lincoln helped transform American agriculture.

The night was gloomy enough to make the plainest of homes seem cheery by contrast. Since morning the skies had been dully gray, so that every one who went out wore arctics and carried umbrellas, and was provoked because no storm came. At about the time when the sun might be supposed to be setting, somewhere behind that dismal wall of clouds, a few tiny, shivering flakes had come floating down or up, one could hardly tell which, and had mingled with the dust that, driven by the biting wind, had filled the air, and piled itself in little ridges along the sidewalk, and blinded the eyes of men and beasts throughout the dreary day. Before long the snow overcame the low-born friend with whom it had at first treacherously allied itself, laid it prostrate on the earth, and calling in all its forces rioted victoriously over the field.

The War for Independence had been won, but economic depression, social unrest, interstate rivalries, and foreign intrigue appeared to be unraveling the fragile confederation. In early 1787, Congress called for a special convention of all the states to revise the Articles of Confederation. On September 17, 1787, after four months of closed sessions in which no reporters or visitors were permitted, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention emerged from their Philadelphia meeting room with an entirely new plan of government -- the U.S. Constitution -- that they hoped would ensure the survival of the experiment they had launched in 1776. To date, the Constitution remains the basis of U.S. law. Though it has been amended 27 times since its first drafting, it stands today as the longest-lasting written constitution in the world.

Experts on human development point out that we feel most alive when we play. Play isn't just a luxury, it's a necessity. Just as eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep are important to our physical and mental health, so is play: through playing, we learn to manage and control a variety of emotions and experiences. Play relieves stress, improves learning, and helps us connect to others and the environment around us. It makes us more productive when we're working, and makes our work more pleasurable. When we play with our kids, it bolsters their self-esteem and stimulates their logic, reasoning, and critical-thinking skills. Play benefits everyone.

Giacomo Puccini is a big, broad man, with a frank open countenance, dark kindly eyes of a lazy lustrous depth, and a shy retiring manner. He is, operatically, the man of the moment. It was behind the scenes during the autumn season of opera at Covent Garden in 1905 that I had the privilege of meeting and talking with him, and about the last thing I could extract from him was anything about his music. One thing struck me as peculiarly characteristic about his nature. The success of Madama Butterfly was at the moment the talk of the town. Puccini was full, not of the success of his opera, but of the achievements of the artists who were interpreting it. ""Isn't Madame So-and-so fine?"" ""Doesn't Signor So-and-so conduct admirably?"" ""Isn't it beautifully put on?"" The composer was content and happy to sink into the background and think, in the triumph, of all he owed to those who were carrying out his ideas.

Before you even start, put on your life jacket. When getting into your canoe, have someone hold it for you. Keep your knees bent and grab onto both sides of the canoe to help keep your balance. To keep the canoe from tipping, always walk along the canoe's center. After you're in the canoe, stay low; never stand straight up when you're away from shore. Avoid sudden or jerky movements like rocking from side to side. Be aware of the currents and try to paddle to calmer spots. If there are waves, paddle straight into them at 90 degrees; being parallel with waves can roll your canoe over. If you adhere to these tips, the chances of tipping your canoe will be low.

According to the passage, when waves are coming toward your canoe,

A.	grab onto both sides of your canoe when parallel to waves.

Before climbing into bed I drink calming tea, take a shower, and then read for ten minutes in bed. It's rare for me to stray from this schedule.

If it suspects it is being watched it may hop from twig to twig and from bush to bush for many minutes before revealing its secret, and if it becomes very apprehensive it may even drop its burden and begin a search for insects with the air of one who had never even dreamed of building a nest.

Never in his life had he seen a river before -- this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver -- glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.

Desiring to rid the world of ""pagan beliefs,"" Christians took established native traditions and transformed them into Christian practices. This practice worked quite well as a strategy for spreading Christianity. It was Pope Boniface IV who replaced the Celtic holiday of Samhain with the Christian holiday of All Martyrs Day. The new holiday was designed to celebrate deceased saints and honor the dead, and replaced the Celtic view of the day as a time when the ghosts of the dead mingled with the living. The holiday eventually became known as All Hallows Day and was celebrated on November 1st. The night before All Hallows Day, called All Hallows Eve, over time became known as Halloween.

One of the first things the owners' insurance company will likely do is consult a forensic meteorologist -- an investigator who specializes in the impact of weather conditions on legal cases and claims. Using a combination of data, science, and interpretation, the work of a forensic meteorologist is much like the work of a detective in solving a crime. In this case, the work of the forensic meteorologist will be to verify that lightning was actually present when the house caught fire. Using the best weather data available, the specialist will try to reconstruct the scenario of weather conditions at the time of the fire.

The passage suggests that one responsibility of forensic meteorologists is to

A.	verify insurance claims that are made due to severe weather.
B.	forecast weather conditions to prevent damage to homes.
C.	assess the value of homes damaged by lightning strikes.
D.	investigate crimes that occur during severe weather.

When slowly moving ground water dissolves underground rocks leaving behind tunnels, odd-shaped passages, and even large caverns, the result is called a solution cave. Another type of cave, called a sea cave, is formed in much the same way, or by wave action, except that the water comes from seas or oceans. Unlike solution caves, sea caves are commonly found underwater. Lava caves are formed when volcanic lava flows cool and harden on the surface while molten lava continues flowing inside; after the molten lava drains out, a hollow tube or tunnel is left. Glacial caves are the result of melt water that excavates drainage tunnels through ice. Other types of caves exist, but these four categories represent the most common types. Most caves in the world are solution caves, and they are often the largest.

Which of the following statements about caves is suggested by the passage?

A.	Caves are nearly always found above sea level.
B.	Over time, water erodes lava, creating caves.
C	Most caves are created by moving water.
D.	Most caves are found underwater.

What is the peculiarity of Othello? What is the distinctive impression that it leaves? Of all Shakespeare's tragedies, I would answer, not even excepting King Lear, Othello is the most painfully exciting and the most terrible. From the moment when the temptation of the hero begins, the reader's heart and mind are held in a vice, experiencing the extremes of pity and fear, sympathy and repulsion, sickening hope and dreadful expectation. Evil is displayed before him, not indeed with the profusion found in King Lear, but forming, as it were, the soul of a single character, and united with an intellectual superiority so great that he watches its advance fascinated and appalled. He sees it, in itself almost irresistible, aided at every step by fortunate accidents and the innocent mistakes of its victims.

Based on the passage, the view of the author is most likely that

A.	King Lear and Othello are equally exciting and terrible.
B.	A uniquely evil character is illustrated in Othello.
C.	Othello, the play, is too extreme to enjoy.
D.	Othello is a better play than King Lear.

I now come to that part of my life during which I planned, and succeeded in making, my escape from slavery. But before narrating any of the peculiar circumstances, I deem it proper to make known my intention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction. My reasons … may be understood from the following: First, were I to give a minute statement of all the facts, it is quite probable, that others would thereby be involved in the most embarrassing difficulties. Secondly, such a statement would undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part of slaveholders; which would, of course, be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his galling chains. I deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my experience.

A Lion lay asleep in the forest when a little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly. In her fright and haste to get away she ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature. ""Spare me!"" begged the poor Mouse. ""Please let me go and someday I will surely repay you."" The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go. Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free. ""You laughed when I said I would repay you,"" said the Mouse. ""Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion.""

For perennialists, what matters most is that students gain an understanding of the great ideas about human civilizations -- that which is enduring and unchanging -- so that they have cultural literacy and the potential to solve problems in any area. The philosophy of essentialism is based on the idea that students must learn what is practical for functioning in society intellectually and morally. Progressivism stresses the idea that students should test ideas through active experimentation. The focus is on the child rather than on content or the teacher. Reconstructionist educators focus on a curriculum that highlights social reform as the aim of education. They want to help students find solutions to such problems as violence, hunger, and inequality. Educators may subscribe to one or more of these philosophical approaches in their classrooms.

Based on the passage, the author's main point is that

A.	educators can choose which philosophy to apply in their classroom.
B.	educators may subscribe to one or more than one approach.
C.	philosophy has a profound impact on American education.
D.	there are many approaches to educational philosophy.

The philosophy based on the concept that ideas are the only true reality is called idealism. The polar opposite of idealism is called realism; realists believe that reality is found solely in concrete objects or the physical body -- that which can be observed. Next, pragmatism is an approach that assesses the value of ideas or beliefs in terms of their practical application. Finally, existentialism is the perspective that one sees the world as having no purpose beyond what is chosen by the individual; that is, we must take personal responsibility for deciding who we are -- an individual must create his or her own meaning. It may be apparent that no single philosophy offers a universal foundation.

Based on the passage, the author's main point is that

A.	certain philosophies are superior.
B.	philosophies can orient and disorient people.
C.	some viewpoints about the world are incorrect.
D.	there are different ways people can view the world.

The WASPs, Women Airforce Service Pilots, served as civilian pilots flying military aircraft in order to free up male pilots for combat duty overseas. The WAVES, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (for the Navy), fulfilled clerical, aviation, medical, and intelligence needs both domestically and overseas. WACS, Women's Army Corps, also served at home and abroad as weather observers, metal workers, mechanics, instructors, clerks, secretaries, cryptographers, and in many other needed specializations. In the Coast Guard's Women's Reserve, or SPARs, women filled many stateside roles including monitoring military communication systems.

It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company -- for he did all the talking. We fell together, as modest people will, in the tail of the herd that was being shown through, and he at once began to say things which interested me. As he talked along, softly, pleasantly, flowingly, he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world and time, and into some remote era and old forgotten country; and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that I seemed to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray antiquity, holding speech with a relic of it!

With their crisp and juicy texture, Honeycrisps are often ranked as a high-quality apple and offer a balanced mix of sweet and tart tastes. If they are harvested early in the season, the flavor is generally mild; those harvested toward the end of the season may be more strongly aromatic. They store well; even after six months in a refrigerator, Honeycrisp apples still have outstanding flavor and texture. A popular apple, Honeycrisps were named the Minnesota State Fruit in 2006. With their superior flavor and texture, Honeycrisp apples are often more expensive than other types.

According to the passage, which Honeycrisp apples are likely to have the strongest aroma?

Some biologists believe the dead keratin cells on the outer skin absorb water, causing the skin's surface area to swell more than the skin deeper down, producing wrinkles. Another theory holds that narrowing blood vessels create the wrinkles. Yet another theory is that nerve fibers shrink when hands are in water, causing them to pull the skin deeper, resulting in wrinkles. Some believe that when water washes natural oils from the skin, the skin absorbs water and swells -- but only in those places where it isn't tied down by tissues -- causing wrinkles. In any case, because these wrinkles are temporary, few people are losing sleep worrying about it.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

A.	Before spending time in the water, one should oil one's hands.
B.	Theories about how water wrinkles skin are still inconclusive.

Many simply believe they can tell when their meat is ready by judging its color and texture. Experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that such practices are unwise because of the risk of foodborne illnesses. Every year, a number of people become seriously ill from food poisoning; sometimes the result is fatal. The CDC reminds everyone to prepare first by thorough hand washing before handling food. Then when grilling meat, use a thermometer to check its internal temperature: 145°F for whole meats, 160°F for ground meats, and 165°F for all poultry. After reaching these safe minimum cooking temperatures, meat should be kept hot at 140°F or above. As long as these precautions are taken, summer grilling can be fun and safe.

People tell us that art makes us love nature more than we loved it before; that it reveals its secrets to us; and that after a careful study of famous painters we see things in it that had escaped our observation. My own experience is that the more we study art, the less we care for nature. What art really reveals to us is nature's lack of design, her curious crudities, her extraordinary monotony, her absolutely unfinished condition. Nature has good intentions, of course, but, as Aristotle once said, she cannot carry them out. When I look at a landscape I cannot help seeing all its defects. It is fortunate for us, however, that nature is so imperfect, as otherwise we should have no art at all. Art is our spirited protest, our gallant attempt to teach nature her proper place.""

Today I see him standing, dimly revealed through the mist of falling snows; tomorrow's sun will show the outline of his gnarled limbs -- all rose color with their soft snow burden; and again a few months, and spring will breathe on him, and he will draw a long breath, and break out once more, for the three hundredth time, perhaps, into a vernal crown of leaves.

He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the stream, the beating of the dragon flies' wings, the strokes of the water spiders' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat -- all these made audible music.

The 35mm is probably the most common and you could get a professional quality one very inexpensively. If you are definitely staying with 35mm film, then an RF camera might be a better alternative. Though less popular than an SLR, it is smaller, quieter, and has better optics. My RF is my favorite film camera, but I do tend to use my SLR more because it is more versatile. A medium format camera uses film that can be up to twice as large as 35mm film. One of the biggest reasons for choosing medium format is that the larger film size produces more accurate tonal differences in your prints. Large format film is much larger than medium format film, and the tonal quality is astonishing. However, both medium and large format cameras are expensive and very difficult to use correctly. I hope this information helps you make a decision about what kind of camera to buy.

Based on the passage, which camera type is the author's favorite?

One of the most celebrated and productive inventors and innovators, Thomas Edison is generally credited for inventing the phonograph, the first commercially successful incandescent light bulb, and the first commercially successful motion picture projector. He was interested in science from an early age but never received more than a few months of formal education. Born in Ohio in 1847, Edison's most fortunate childhood advantage was that his parents taught him how to use the resources of a local library -- and his appetite for knowledge was voracious. He was prolific, energetic, and competitive during his career, racing to invent, innovate, patent, produce, or market products before others. For example, Edison improved upon the telegraph and the stock ticker, and he nearly secured a patent for the telephone before Alexander Graham Bell. Although Edison never ran for public office, he did his part in leading the country into a new era.

That the future of invention is to be as brilliant as its past, every omen indicates. In what direction will it proceed? Probably in all directions. But the line of direction that will occur the first to many, is probably in aerial flight. Doubtless it is in aerial flight that the greatest advance has been made since flight was first successfully accomplished in 1903; and doubtless it is in that line that the greatest progress is being made now. The enormous speeds already achieved; the growing size of both airplanes and dirigibles; their increasing speed, safety and convenience; the fact that roads are not needed for aerial transportation as they are for carriages and railway trains, or deep water channels as for water craft; and the comparative cheapness with which people and light packages can be carried swiftly and far, all point to a vast increase in aerial transportation, and a great modification in all our modes of living in consequence.

According to the passage, further advances will occur first in aerial flight because

The apple has long been the most popular of our tree fruits, but the last few years have seen a steady growth in its appreciation and use. This is probably due in a large measure to a better knowledge of its value and to the development of new methods of preparation for consumption. Few fruits can be utilized in as many ways as can the apple. In addition to the common use of the fresh fruit out of hand and of the fresh, sweet juice as cider, this ""King of Fruits"" can be cooked, baked, dried, canned, and made into jellies and other appetizing dishes…. Few who have tasted once want to be without their apple sauce and apple pies in season, not to mention the crisp, juicy specimens to eat out of hand by the open fireplace in the long winter evenings. Apples thus served call up pleasant memories to most of us, but only recently have the culinary possibilities of the apple, especially as a dessert fruit, been fully realized.

One afternoon when the sun was going down, a mother and her son sat talking about the Great Stone Face. They had but to lift their eyes, and there it was plainly to be seen, though miles away. And what was the Great Stone Face? It was a work of majestic playfulness, formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks, which had been thrown together in such a position as, when viewed at a proper distance, precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance. It seemed as if an enormous giant had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice. There was the broad arch of the forehead, a hundred feet in height; the nose, with its long bridge; and the vast lips, which, if they could have spoken, would have rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other.

When the first European explorers began finding their way to what is now Glacier National Park in the northwestern corner of Montana, it was not the area's majestic scenery that lured them there. In fact, most of them came in search of natural resources. One such resource, for example, was beaver pelts, which were in demand in Europe because they were believed to make the best-quality hats.

When I was a child of seven years old, my friends, on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children; and being charmed with the sound of a whistle, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth; put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the money; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure.

Such humble beginnings hardly appeared to suggest that the railroad would become what some have called the single greatest invention of the Industrial Revolution. The ongoing desire to improve the railroad sparked many inventions, such as enhancements to the steam engine, which had already revolutionized boat travel. The desire to build railroads led to improvements in surveying and mapmaking. The growth of railway systems demanded growth in bridge engineering, and led to population expansion and economic and commercial growth across the nation. The railroad not only succeeded in its own right, but also carried the weight of the Industrial Revolution on its great iron wheels.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?
 
A.	Using horses to pull heavy loads on tracks was misguided.
B.	Though of modest origins, the railroads were a major force of change.
C.	The Industrial Revolution sparked the beginnings of the railway system.

In 2010, research biologists, in collaboration with Yosemite National Park staff, officially recognized a new species of pseudoscorpion, called the Yosemite cave pseudoscorpion (Parobisium yosemite), crawling within Yosemite's talus caves. Yosemite Valley's talus slopes create caves of various sizes, and within two caves located in close proximity, the tiny pseudoscorpion -- about the length of a fingernail -- was discovered. A pseudoscorpion is an arachnid that resembles a true scorpion but does not possess a stinger or a tail. More than 3,000 species exist worldwide. This discovery will further inspire biologists to explore regions of the park not traditionally sampled for new fauna. Biologists have typically investigated limestone and marble caves for new species, rather than talus caves. But now, biologists in Yosemite have made it a top priority to continue further research into the park's talus cave ecosystem to learn more about these relatively unexplored areas thought to house additional pseudoscorpion species.

According to the passage, the discovery of the Parobisium yosemite has

A.	inspired biologists to explore regions of the park not traditionally sampled.

James Cook does not appear to have enjoyed any peculiar educational advantages, but owed his subsequent advancement chiefly to his own intelligence, perseverance, and diligence. He first went to a village school, and was afterwards sent to an ordinary commercial school, kept by a Mr. Pullen. He continued there four years, and was then apprenticed to Mr. William Sanderson, a grocer and haberdasher at the fishing town of Straiths. It may be supposed that the occupation in which he was engaged was not suited to his taste. The sea was constantly before his eyes, and the desire to seek his fortune on it grew stronger and stronger. About a year after he went to Straiths he obtained a release from his engagement with Mr. Sanderson, and apprenticed himself to Messrs. Walker and Company, shipowners of Whitby. He went to sea for the first time when he was about eighteen….

On looking upwards I beheld him hanging by his bridle to the steeple. Matters were now very plain to me: the village had been covered with snow overnight; a sudden change of weather had taken place; I had sunk down to the churchyard whilst asleep, gently, and in the same proportion as the snow had melted away; and what in the dark I had taken to be a stump of a little tree appearing above the snow, to which I had tied my horse, proved to have been the cross of the steeple!

Such machines were ""invented"" by Rube Goldberg, a cartoonist who conceptualized them as a way to mock America's addiction to technology in the early twentieth century. One famous example is his Self-Operating Napkin, a device worn on a person's head while eating soup. The person's soup spoon is tied to a ladle, which jerks as the spoon is raised to the person's mouth. The jerked ladle tosses a cracker over a parrot, who jumps after the cracker. The jump tilts the parrot's perch, spilling seeds into a pail, which pulls a cord as it is being filled. The cord opens and lights an automatic cigar lighter, setting off a skyrocket, causing a sickle to cut a string tied to a pendulum, which begins to swing. A napkin attached to the pendulum swings across the person's face, wiping his or her mouth.

He dwells on a portrait of his deceased wife. Throughout the monologue, we learn that the Duke is an extremely jealous individual who suspected his wife was unfaithful: ""she liked whate'er she looked on, and her looks went everywhere."" While the Duke does not explicitly take responsibility for his wife's death, his disgust and resentment are highly suggestive of his culpability. His irrational anger continuing even after his wife's death further illustrates the deeply disturbing psychology of the Duke. In a twist of irony, we later discover that the person the Duke is talking to is the representative of a Count whose daughter he wants to now marry.

The volunteers, who were all middle-class male college students, were randomly divided into two equal groups: prison guards and prisoners. A mock prison was constructed in the basement of an academic building, which the prisoners -- like ""real"" prisoners -- were not permitted to leave. The objective of the experiment was to observe how social constructs, power dynamics, and environmental factors shape how people treat one another. Amazingly, developments forced the professor to abort the project after only six days. Because of the unexpected brutality of the prison guard volunteers and the intense suffering and humiliation of the volunteer prisoners, continuing the experiment would have breached ethical standards.

A time of great social change, the Jazz Age was a time when the young generation rebelled against many of America's most deeply held traditions. As a new cosmopolitan culture with a consumer-oriented economy and mass entertainment rose, established social constructs related to class, race, religion, and gender were tested and defied. Hollywood movies, in particular, played a role in the dissemination of ideas and ideals about this time period. Of course, jazz music was becoming increasingly popular and jazz musicians such as Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong became stars. The era came to be known for its luxury and excessiveness, a time when, as Fitzgerald put it, ""the parties were bigger, the pace was faster, the buildings were higher, and morals were looser.""

The object of the expedition was to complete the survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826 to 1830, -- to survey the shores of Chile, Peru, and of some islands in the Pacific -- and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the World. On the 6th of January we reached Teneriffe, but were prevented landing, by fears of our bringing the cholera: the next morning we saw the sun rise behind the rugged outline of the Grand Canary island, and suddenly illuminate the Peak of Teneriffe, whilst the lower parts were veiled in fleecy clouds.

Having been influenced by War and Peace, the masterpiece epic written by his contemporary Leo Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky set out to create a story equal in breadth that would encapsulate his philosophical ideas and deepest concerns about the world. The Brothers Karamazov, which contains 12 books and an epilogue, was to be the first half of a larger epic, The Life of a Great Sinner. Unfortunately, Dostoyevsky died unexpectedly soon after its publication. The Brothers Karamazov certainly stands alone, however. A moving tale about three brothers and a murder mystery about their father, the novel weaves complex and often fearful musings on morality and the human condition by one of history's greatest thinkers.

The most famous gorgon was Medusa, who was once a beautiful maiden with long, magnificent hair. Athena, however, who was the goddess of wisdom, transformed Medusa into a gorgon because Poseidon, the god of the sea, desired her. After her transformation, Medusa became so hideous that anyone who looked at her would turn to stone. Later, Perseus was tasked by the king to slay Medusa -- difficult to do, not being able to look at his target. Perseus, being a great as well as clever hero, managed to do it nevertheless. The story ends on a less grim note, though. According to the myth, from Medusa's wounded body sprang forth Pegasus, a beautiful winged horse.

In the poem, which is believed to have been composed sometime around the eighth century, the hero Beowulf, prince of the Geats, comes to the aid of King Hrothgar, whose mead hall is nightly terrorized by a monster named Grendel. One night, Beowulf confronts and mortally wounds Grendel. After Beowulf and King Hrothgar celebrate the next day, Grendel's mother arrives that night and avenges her son's death by killing one of King Hrothgar's men. The following morning, Beowulf and Grendel's mother engage in a fight, and Beowulf again emerges as the winner. After 50 years of peace, during which Beowulf becomes king of the Geats, a fire-breathing dragon threatens his kingdom. Beowulf successfully slays the dragon, but he is mortally wounded in the fight.

Following the 1951 publication of his debut novel, The Catcher in the Rye, it became apparent that Salinger's conceit was justified. Considered by many to be one of the most important emerging writers in the twentieth century, Salinger was compared to American literary legends such as Mark Twain. The Catcher in the Rye became an immediate, best-selling sensation, achieving the rare combination of critical acclaim and commercial success. Deeply disillusioned by the fame produced by his success, however, Salinger longed for privacy and, after publishing a couple of novels and a handful of short stories, stopped publishing his work altogether. He relocated to a rural part of New Hampshire and seldom left the area. Even after Salinger's death in 2010, The Catcher in the Rye continues to be read widely.

While many conflicting stories exist regarding the origins of oorah, historians have traced the word back to the 1950s during the Korean War. Stationed in Korea, Marines in the 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Company started to imitate the sound of a klaxon alarm -- a horn sound used on early motor vehicles -- as a way to motivate themselves during physical training.

Every possible means of preservation, -- sentimental, educational and legislative, -- must be employed. The present warning issues with no uncertain sound, because this great battle for preservation and conservation cannot be won by gentle tones, nor by appeals to the aesthetic instincts of those who have no sense of beauty, or enjoyment of Nature.

The ""crossing the river problems"" is a medieval class of puzzles. Probably the earliest example was by Abbot Alcuin, who was born in Yorkshire in 735 and died at Tours in 804. Everybody knows the story of the man with the wolf, goat, and basket of cabbages whose boat would only take one of the three at a time with the man himself. His difficulties arose from his being unable to leave the wolf alone with the goat, or the goat alone with the cabbages. These puzzles were considered by Tartaglia and Bachet, and have been later investigated by Lucas, De Fonteney, Delannoy, Tarry, and others.

As I now recall it, in the long winter evenings when the frost was crackling out of doors, my mother would sit with her spindle, rocking my brother's cradle with her foot, and humming a song, which I seem to hear even now. The fat-lamp, quivering and flaring up as though in fear of something, lighted us within our cottage; the spindle hummed; and all of us children, collected in a cluster, listened to grandfather talk about some deed of old which always sent a shiver through our frames, and made our hair rise upright on our heads. But the chief thing about grandfather's stories was, we children felt, that he never had lied in all his life; and whatever he said was so, was so.

In the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to

A.	describe how gullible he was.
B.	reminisce on his childhood in poverty.
C.	set an atmospheric tone for the ghost tale to come.
D.	convince the reader that the tale he is about to tell is true.

This native wildflower was named after Thomas Jefferson by his friend John Bartram, once Royal Botanist to King George III and author of America's first nursery catalog. Bartram claimed, ""the Botanick fire set me in such A flame as is not to be quenched untill death or I explore most of the South western vegetative treasures in North America."" Jeffersonia blooms around its namesake's birthday on April 13. Each delicate white bloom has but a couple of days to shine. And, each day, it unravels, slowly. If you are still, you can almost sense the flutter of the petals. I rarely get to see a fully opened flower: The blossoms remain open for just a couple of hours. As flowers fade, the leaves take their place. This plant is also called ""twinleaf,"" its two-part leaves like butterfly wings. By May, brighter flowers burst onto center stage, taking over. Still, I remember those pale twinleaf blooms well into winter -- until the next splash of them makes a fleeting appearance.

In the passage, the author's main purpose is most likely to

A.	introduce a different side of Jefferson.
B.	discuss the writer's gardening philosophy.
C.	celebrate Bartram's contribution to botany.
D.	draw attention to a modest, but fascinating plan.

There is even an entire park devoted to them, Parque de las Palomas, where they nest in the City Wall, lounge in trees overlooking the San Juan Bay, and get daily feedings from gleeful children. It's a Pigeon Riviera. Old trees with gnarled roots flank the small park. Their branches are covered with pigeons, en masse, an unnerving sight. As you approach, a wave of expectation seems to wash over you from the birds' beady eyes. Luckily, for just one dollar, you can buy a proper tribute from seed sellers nearby -- if you dare, that is. Flocks and flocks of these birds will not be shy in claiming it. But not all is luxury and leisure in their lives. There is another presence on Old Town streets, just as watchful of these birds as they are of you: cats. But I shall stop here. The cats of San Juan deserve a story of their own.

Based on the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to portray pigeons of San Juan as

I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges.

They lived in a forlorn-looking house that stood alone and had an air of starvation. A few straggling savin-trees, emblems of sterility, grew near it; no smoke ever curled from its chimney; no traveler stopped at its door. A miserable horse, whose ribs were as articulate as the bars of a gridiron, stalked about a field, where a thin carpet of moss, scarcely covering the ragged beds of pudding-stone, tantalized and balked his hunger; and sometimes he would lean his head over the fence, look piteously at the passer-by, and seem to petition deliverance from this land of famine.

What is it that confers the noblest delight? What is that which swells a man's breast with pride above that which any other experience can bring to him? Discovery! To know that you are walking where none others have walked; that you are beholding what human eye has not seen before; that you are breathing a virgin atmosphere. To give birth to an idea -- to discover a great thought -- an intellectual nugget, right under the dust of a field that many a brain-plow had gone over before. To find a new planet, to invent a new hinge, to find the way to make the lightnings carry your messages. To be the first -- that is the idea. To do something, say something, see something, before anybody else -- these are the things that confer a pleasure compared with which other pleasures are tame and commonplace, other ecstasies cheap and trivial.

Generally, instinctively, in the absence of any special reason, humanity hates the idea of anything being hidden -- that is, it hates the idea of anything being successfully hidden. Hide-and-seek is a popular pastime; but it assumes the truth of the text, ""Seek and ye shall find."" Ordinary mankind (gigantic and unconquerable in its power of joy) can get a great deal of pleasure out of a game called ""hide the thimble,"" but that is only because it is really a game of ""see the thimble."" Suppose that at the end of such a game the thimble had not been found at all; suppose its place was unknown forever: the result on the players would not be playful, it would be tragic. That thimble would hagride all their dreams. They would all die in asylums. The pleasure is all in the poignant moment of passing from not knowing to knowing.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	excuse people for their simple pleasures.

The same D is played again three times, but the next note is the A played a fourth down. We know this is a D chord, but we don't know if it is a major or minor D. This is because we do not know if the third note up from the D is an F, which would render the chord a D minor, or an F sharp, which would render the chord a D major. Eventually, after about two minutes of what seems like an irresolute minor key, the music settles into a major key and repeats the theme throughout the remainder of the movement. It is very satisfying. The second movement is very playful as it repeats the initial theme over and over, altering the pattern and dynamics of it (as well as the key it's played in -- major to minor, etc.). A charming secondary theme is introduced about a minute into the second movement -- it's as if the two themes are dancing together in an empty ballroom.

These schools were established on the premise that they would enter into contracts (i.e., charters) detailing specific goals that they would be accountable for achieving in exchange for independence from many of the laws and regulations that govern traditional public schools. This flexibility is intended to allow charter schools to educate students in new and potentially more effective ways and, in doing so, to serve as incubators for innovative ideas that could be adopted more widely as part of the nation's efforts to reform and improve public education. Charter schools provide an academic alternative for students, increasing the public school choices for parents, and opportunities for educators to create schools based on a particular mission and vision.

Salt is the main source of sodium for most people, but some common food additives -- like monosodium glutamate, sodium nitrite, and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) -- also contain sodium and contribute in lesser amounts to the total amount of ""sodium"" listed on the Nutrition Facts label. Surprisingly, some foods that don't taste salty -- like cereals and pastries -- can still be high in sodium, so don't always use taste as a guide if you're trying to keep track of your salt intake.

This plant is native to the tropical rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia, and was first discovered in 1878. Its putrid smell is most potent during peak bloom at night into the early morning. The odor is often compared to the stench of rotting flesh. The flowering of the plant also generates heat, which allows the stench to travel further. This combination of heat and smell efficiently attracts pollinators, such as dung and carrion beetles, from across long distances. The corpse plant does not have an annual blooming cycle. The time between flowering is unpredictable and can span from a few years to a few decades. The plant requires very special conditions, including warm day and night temperatures and high humidity, making a botanical garden well suited to support this strange plant outside of its natural range.

According to the passage, what entices pollinators to the Amorphophallus titanum?

A.	warm days and nights

The stunning vistas and barren ""badlands"" of the park are a result of the interaction between geology and climate. Consistent with the rest of the Puerco River basin, the bedrock in the park is composed of gently northeast-dipping Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. The interbedded shales and siltstones of the Chinle formation provide the components necessary for both the erosion-resistant sandstone caps of the cuestas and mesas and the highly erodable underlying shale and siltstones. Triassic volcanism resulted in the deposition of the ash in the park that weathered to form the montmorillonite clay (also referred to as bentonite) found in the park today. Volcanic ash may have been transported by the wind from volcanic fields as far to the west as Nevada. The deposited ash served as the source for the leached silica believed to be responsible for the petrifaction of the logs which are the park's main attraction.

According to the passage, the ash deposits that formed into bentonite originated from

A.	Triassic volcanism.

My first impression of this music (from the recording) was not favorable. It seemed discordant, edgy, and demented, especially in the second movement, Allegro brusco , where I felt like the melodic theme was on the edge of falling into complete chaos (along with my sanity). A live rendering of this piece changed my opinion of it entirely. I could hear the pianissimo parts more clearly than in the recording. The two bookend movements gave me the sense of a daydream. In places, the music was trancelike, hard to follow logically, unreliable, and tenuous. These two movements were my favorites. About two minutes from the conclusion of each of these movements is an almost rarefied and very quietly played set of rapid, running notes on violin, while the piano by contrast plays slow, simple chords.

Warblers, tanagers, orioles, finches, and hundreds of other species make up this diverse group of birds. Their names often denote their colorful plumage: Indigo Bunting, Yellow Warbler, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Purple Martin, and many more. Songbirds are among the smallest of our birds and are called passerines or ""perching birds,"" meaning they can hold tightly to branches with their ""toes."" Passerines can be found in virtually every habitat in the U.S., such as forests, prairies, wetlands, and deserts. They eat a variety of foods, including insects, seeds, berries, nectar, and fruit. Their appetite for insects helps farmers and foresters as songbirds annually consume millions of insects that, if unchecked, could damage crops and trees. Some birds eat as many as 300 insects a day during the summer months. Songbirds enrich our lives; they are as beneficial as they are beautiful.

I have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who understood the art of walking, that is, of taking walks, -- who had a genius, so to speak, for sauntering: which word is beautifully derived from ""idle people who roved about the country, in the Middle Ages, and asked charity, under pretense of going a la Sainte Terre,"" to the Holy Land, till the children exclaimed, ""There goes a Sainte-Terrer,"" a Saunterer. Some, however, would derive the word from sans terre, without land or a home, which, therefore, in the good sense, will mean, having no particular home, but equally at home everywhere. For this is the secret of successful sauntering. One who sits still in a house all the time may be the greatest vagrant of all; but the saunterer, in the good sense, is no more vagrant than the meandering river, which is all the while sedulously seeking the shortest course to the sea.

Although most historians pinpoint the start of Rock and Roll to the mid-1950s, there were much earlier influences. Music hit the radio airwaves in the 1920s with Tin Pan Alley music. Big Band became popular from 1935-1945 and led to the emergence of solo artists like Frank Sinatra. Rhythm and Blues and Country Western music was also influential at this time. From 1955-1959, Rock and Roll came alive with music sensations like Bill Haley and Elvis Presley. Many music historians consider the time around 1959 to be the death of the original Rock and Roll due to, among other factors, the death of Buddy Holly, the military enlistment of Elvis Presley, and the change in musical focus of artists like Little Richard and Chuck Berry.

First, the location of the tree must be determined -- one that will give the tree enough space to grow to full size. After deciding where to plant the tree, dig a hole twice the size of and slightly shallower than the tree's root ball. Next, loosen the soil around the hole. This helps roots establish themselves. Now it is time to remove the tree from its container and to separate the roots so they do not strangle the trunk as the tree grows. Next, fill in the hole around the root ball and gently pack the soil to prevent air pockets. Finally, the tree must be watered thoroughly. Covering the planting area with mulch is recommended. Following these steps will help produce a healthy tree.

In what we may term 'prescientific days' people were in no uncertainty about the interpretation of dreams. …[T]hey were regarded as either the friendly or hostile manifestation of some higher powers, demoniacal and Divine. With the rise of scientific thought the whole of this expressive mythology was transferred to psychology; today there is but a small minority among educated persons who doubt that the dream is the dreamer's own psychical act. But since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an interpretation of the dream has been wanting. The conditions of its origin; its relationship to our psychical life when we are awake; the dream's evanescence, the way in which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust it aside as something bizarre -- all these and many other problems have for many hundred years demanded answers which up till now could never have been satisfactory.

On the other hand, one of the most important means of developing power in public speaking is to pause either before or after, or both before and after, an important word or phrase. No one who would be a forceful speaker can afford to neglect this principle -- one of the most significant that has ever been inferred from listening to great orators. Study this potential device until you have absorbed and assimilated it.

Which of the following best restates the author's main point?

A.	Correct use of pauses can have a powerful effect.
B.	Effective speakers can sometimes stumble.
C.	Pause before or after important words.
D.	One should study the great orators.

There is usually only one queen honeybee and she is the mother of all of the other bees in the colony. Her main function is reproduction. Annually, one queen can produce up to 250,000 eggs. The other female honeybees are known as worker bees, and they make up the majority of the colony. From caring for the queen to collecting resources to defending the hive, the worker bees do it all. The third type of honeybee, drones, are male and have one job. They typically mate with queen bees from other colonies. To survive, all three types of honeybees depend on support from the colony.

According to the passage, which of the following is true of worker bees?

A.	They account for most of the population of the colony.
B.	They produce up to 250,000 eggs annually.

If you're keeping them in adverse environments like these, your books are suffering. Like people, books are sensitive to heat, light, and humidity. They tend to last longer when they are kept in a more suitable environment. The best place for preserving the life of your books is a cool, dry room. Exposure to light should be kept to a minimum, because too much light -- direct or intense light -- harms them. Avoid attics, basements, and any area that can get very hot, cold, or wet. Shelve books of similar size together to provide support on each side. Do not allow books to lean at an angle; keeping books standing upright and straight or lying down flat helps keep their spines from becoming damaged. These few simple steps can keep your books in great shape for years to come.

Based on the passage, it is okay to store books

A.	leaning at an angle.
B.	in a hot, dry attic.

But as coffee plantations in Central and South America have been switching from growing shade coffee to sun coffee, they've been destroying the tropical forests that have been the winter habitat of many species of migratory birds. Coffee production in Central and South America used to include predominantly ""shade"" varieties of coffee, grown under the tropical forest canopy. In recent decades, growers have been destroying forests so they can raise coffee varieties that thrive in full sun. These varieties ripen faster, but also require fertilizer and pesticides that shade coffees don't. When the migratory birds arrive to find their old habitats gone, they must relocate to smaller forests where resources become scarce, and fewer birds survive.

Which of the following best summarizes the passage?

A.	There is an increasing trend to grow more sun coffee.
B.	Sun-grown coffee reduces habitats for migratory birds.
C.	Migratory birds relocate to smaller forests, with fewer resources.

For starters, never say ""cheese"" to make them smile. Instead, relax, take your time (lots of time), and let your children be who they will be. If there is something they love doing, get them involved with it, and then start clicking. Catch them in action against an interesting background that brings out your children's natural attributes. Take lots of pictures, and be quick; don't wait and wait until the perfect moment. It'll be over before you're ready. Just keep snapping. With unhurried patience, you're bound to catch the right moment sooner or later. Finally, try to blend into the background so your children can forget you are there observing. That way, you might get some real, spontaneous shots.

Which of the following statements best summarizes the passage?

A.	To get good pictures, let children be themselves.

The medical term for this common experience is sternutation. In ordinary language, we call it sneezing. When dust, pollen, dander, or allergens such as pepper find their way into our noses, the nerve endings in our nasal membranes begin to feel tickled. Our brain then triggers a sneeze response to get these foreign invaders out. As we sneeze, air rushes out of our noses at the impressive speed of about 100 miles per hour! Thanks to such an effective system, involving many different physiological processes, one sneeze frequently completes the job, and the offending irritants are gone.

Which of the following best restates the author's main point in the passage?

An example of a high cloud is the cirrus. Such clouds look feathery and are made up entirely of ice crystals. They often signal an approaching warm front. Mid-level clouds start with the word ""alto,"" which simply means mid. They are named as such because they are the main types of clouds at the middle level. They generally appear flat and uniform in texture. Low-level clouds are named either ""strato,"" which means layer; ""cumulo,"" which means heap; or ""nimbo,"" which means rain. These root names are sometimes combined to provide more descriptive names, like altostratus, cirrostratus, or cumulonimbus. A basic familiarity with cloud naming techniques enables weather watchers of all varieties to more accurately predict and converse about the weather.

Much like squirrels, they use these pockets to carry food; but unlike squirrels, their pockets open on the outside of their cheeks and can be turned inside out for easy emptying. Although moles and pocket gophers are somewhat similar in appearance, their diets are entirely different. Moles eat worms and insects, while pocket gophers eat vegetation, such as roots, bulbs, leaves, and stems. Pocket gophers can be a problem for homeowners because they eat garden crops, damage trees, and ruin lawns.

Now that I know better, certain sparrows are among my most favorite birds. The white-throated sparrow is easy to spot with a bright white throat, yellow markings above each eye, and prominent black lines on its head. The chipping sparrow arrives in my backyard in spring. It's a tiny bird with a conspicuous rufous cap that is easy to spot. The golden-crowned sparrow, found only on the West Coast, has a black cap with a single bright yellow forehead stripe. Their song is slow and melancholy. My favorite sparrow by far, is the song sparrow. … If you're not sure you've seen one, you've probably heard one.

If you say the telling of a story is George Eliot's forte, you put her below Wilkie Collins or Mrs. Oliphant; if you say her object is to give a picture of English society, she is surpassed by Bulwer and Trollope; if she be called a satirist of society, Thackeray is her superior; if she intends to illustrate the absurdity of behavior, she is eclipsed by Dickens; but if the analysis of human motives be her forte and art, she stands first, and it is very doubtful whether any artist in fiction is entitled to stand second. She reaches clear in and touches the most secret and the most delicate spring of human action. She has done this so well, so apart from the doing of everything else, and so, in spite of doing some other things indifferently, that she works on a line quite her own, and quite alone, as a creative artist in fiction.

The slowness with which Leonardo worked was proverbial. After the most thorough preliminary studies he painted The Holy Supper for three years in the cloister of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. One of his contemporaries relates that Leonardo often ascended the scaffold very early in the morning and did not leave the brush out of his hand until twilight, never thinking of eating or drinking. Then days passed without putting his hand on it, sometimes he remained for hours before the painting and derived satisfaction from studying it by himself. At other times he came directly to the cloister from the palace of the Milanese Castle where he formed the model of the equestrian statue for Francesco Sforza, in order to add a few strokes with the brush to one of the figures…. According to Vasari he worked for years on the portrait of Mona Lisa without being able to bring it to completion.

Of course, it doesn't ""rain"" frogs or fish in the sense that it rains water -- no one has ever seen frogs or fish vaporize into the air before a rainfall. However, strong winds, such as those in a tornado or hurricane, are powerful enough to lift animals, people, trees, and houses. It is possible that they could suck up a school of fish or frogs and ""rain"" them elsewhere. Many scientists believe tornadic waterspouts may be responsible for frog and fish rainfalls. Like a tornado, a mature waterspout consists of a low-pressure central vortex surrounded by a rotating funnel of updrafts. The vortex at the center of these storms is strong enough to ""suck up"" surrounding air, water, and small objects like a vacuum. These accumulated objects are deposited back to earth as ""rain"" when the waterspout loses its energy.

It is commonly said that everybody can sing in the bathroom; and this is true. Singing is very easy. Drawing, though, is much more difficult. I have devoted a good deal of time to Drawing, one way and another; I have to attend a great many committees and public meetings, and at such functions I find that Drawing is almost the only Art one can satisfactorily pursue during the speeches. One really cannot sing during the speeches; so as a rule I draw. I do not say that I am an expert yet, but after a few more meetings I calculate that I shall know Drawing as well as it can be known. The first thing, of course, is to get on to a really good committee; and by a good committee I mean a committee that provides decent materials. An ordinary departmental committee is no use: generally they only give you a couple of pages of lined foolscap and no white blotting-paper, and very often the pencils are quite soft.

The presence of pillow lava indicates that the volcanic eruption happened when the area was covered by glaciers or was below sea level. Pillow lava has a rounder appearance than other types of lava. As its name implies, it resembles large, fluffy pillows. Despite this defining characteristic, pillow lava can be difficult to distinguish from another type of lava called pahoehoe, which forms on dry land and appears billowy and ropy, like a pan of chocolate brownies. Another type of lava flow, called 'a 'a, is rough and jagged and forms where lava is flowing through open channels on a ground surface. By volume, pillow lava is most abundant. Near the summit of the volcano Mauna Kea one can find real pillow lava; it was formed more than 10,000 years ago by a volcanic eruption under a glacier. More recent pillow lava was formed after the 1998 eruption of Axial Volcano, which is in the Pacific Ocean about 300 miles off the coast of the northwest United States.

Each ""season"" comprises three movements lasting about ten minutes and corresponds to a sonnet that Vivaldi may have written himself. Listeners of these concertos may audibly identify the themes from each season's sonnets. Concerto No. 1 in E Major, or Spring, musically depicts words from the sonnet such as birds, brooks, breezes, lightning, and thunder. Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, or Summer, does the same thing, but depicts a cuckoo, a gentle breeze, hornets, and hail. Concerto No. 3 in F Major, Autumn, depicts song, dance, sleep, and hunters.

In 19th century America, there was already a tradition of having parades, picnics, and various other celebrations in support of labor issues, such as shorter hours or to rally strikers. But most historians emphasize one specific event in the development of today's modern Labor Day. That pivotal event was the parade of unions and a massive picnic that took place in New York City on September 5, 1882. At that time, the labor movement was growing stronger. Many of the unions in New York prospered by joining together into one Central Labor Union made up of members from many local unions. On May 14, 1882, a proposal was made at the Central Labor Union meeting that all workers should join together for a ""monster labor festival"" in early September. When the parade began only a handful of workers were in it. But then slowly they came.

Of the three great Russian novelists of our time Turgenev is by far the finest artist. He has that spirit of exquisite selection, that delicate choice of detail, which is the essence of style; his work is entirely free from any personal intention; and by taking existence at its most fiery-colored moments he can distill into a few pages of perfect prose the moods and passions of many lives. Tolstoy's method is much larger, and his field of vision more extended. We may not at first gain from his works that artistic unity of impression which is Turgenev's chief charm, but once that we have mastered the details the whole seems to have the grandeur and the simplicity of an epic. Dostoevsky differs widely from both his rivals. He is not so fine an artist as Turgenev …. nor has he Tolstoy's largeness of vision and epic dignity; but he has qualities that are distinctively his own, such as a fierce intensity of passion….

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

A.	Tolstoy and Dostoevsky are overrated.
B.	The three novelists have recognizable writing styles.
C.	The better novelists write shorter, more distilled novels.
D.	Turgenev is always overlooked as one of the greatest novelists.

The chronicling of Civil War intelligence activities challenges historians because of the lack of records, the lack of access to records, and the questionable truth of other records. Judah P. Benjamin, the Confederacy's Secretary of State, burned all the intelligence records he could find as federal troops entered Richmond. Union intelligence records were kept sealed in the National Archives until 1953. A few individuals involved in intelligence gathering burned their personal papers while others chose to publish their memoirs, though greatly embellishing their exploits. Even today, the identities of many spies remain secret.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

A.	Most Civil War espionage records cannot be trusted.
B.	Much of Civil War espionage will always remain a mystery.
C.	The Union spy service kept better records during the Civil War.

Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honor of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.

Built as Khufu's tomb, the Great Pyramid is the oldest and largest of the pyramids located on the outskirts of Cairo. It is believed the tomb took 30 years to build: 10 years to build the ramp between the Nile and the pyramid and 20 years to build the structure. With each of the base's sides being approximately 756 feet and the pyramid's original height being around 481 feet, Khufu's pyramid is the largest in the world. It is believed that each stone used to build the pyramid ranged from 2.5 - 9 tons.

Stemming from decades-long investigations into the nature of radioactivity and the properties of irradiated materials, nuclear physicists finally developed two types of nuclear bombs. The first type is known today as a fission bomb, or atomic bomb. In the fission bomb, atoms are split apart and heat, light, and radiation are emitted. The second type of nuclear bomb created was the hydrogen bomb, or fusion bomb. In this type, particles are joined together, giving off energy. Both types represent the most powerful and destructive weapons on earth. At the present time, there are enough of these bombs stored in military arsenals to destroy all life on Earth many times over.

Which of the following best restates the author's main point?

It is mostly my own dreams I talk of, and that will somewhat excuse me for talking of dreams at all. Everyone knows how delightful the dreams are that one dreams one's self, and how insipid the dreams of others are. I had an illustration of the fact, not many evenings ago, when a company of us got telling dreams. I had by far the best dreams of any; to be quite frank, mine were the only dreams worth listening to; they were richly imaginative, delicately fantastic, exquisitely whimsical, and humorous in the last degree; and I wondered that when the rest could have listened to them they were always eager to cut in with some silly, senseless, tasteless thing that made me sorry and ashamed for them. I shall not be going too far if I say that it was on their part the grossest betrayal of vanity that I ever witnessed.

I was the last person picked up by the shuttle, which was nearly full, and I sat directly behind the most talkative person I'd ever heard. Because I was so close, and he so loud, I could hear everything he said, most of which were opinions and attitudes that are diametrically opposed to my own. The more he talked, the angrier I got. Arriving at the airport, I was relieved to get away from this man's rants. I got out of the van, checked in, walked to my gate, and waited to board the plane. As I boarded the plane my ire rose to realize I would again be sitting behind the man in the van -- for a 5-hour flight! He was just as obnoxious as on the van, but as soon as we hit some moderately severe turbulence, I learned he was a pilot and was calming the passengers next to him who were afraid of flying. He gently explained that the turbulence we were flying through was nothing to worry about and why. I found that I, also a nervous flier, felt relieved to listen to his explanations.

One of my Swiss ancestors was the first teacher of the deaf in Zurich and wrote a book on the subject of their education -- rather a singular coincidence; though it is true that there is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has not had a king among his.

It would be difficult to find another man who lived so entirely for his duties. It is not enough to say that Akaky labored with zeal; no, he labored with love. In his copying, he found a varied and agreeable employment. Enjoyment was written on his face; some letters were even favorites with him; and when he encountered these, he smiled, winked, and worked with his lips, till it seemed as though each letter might be read in his face, as his pen traced it. If his pay had been in proportion to his zeal, he would, perhaps, to his great surprise, have been made even a councillor of state. But he worked, as his companions, the wits, put it, like a horse in a mill.

What makes them work so well at keeping time? It has to do with the pendulum. The time it takes for a pendulum to swing and get back to its starting point depends on one thing: its length. Some people might think that the more a pendulum weighs, the slower it will move, but this is not true; its weight makes no difference. This means that when a clock has a pendulum of a certain length, the amount of time it takes for the pendulum to complete one swing can be calculated very precisely. This is why grandfather clocks can keep accurate time without electric power. Such clocks have a system of weights that transfer their potential energy to the pendulum, keeping it going.

In discussing grandfather clocks, the author's primary focus is on

A.	its accuracy without electricity.
B.	its mechanical function and precision.

When the weather is fair and settled, they are clothed in blue and purple, and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky; but, sometimes, when the rest of the landscape is cloudless, they will gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits, which, in the last rays of the setting sun, will glow and light up like a crown of glory.

One thing most bees have in common is that they collect nectar and pollen from flowers. It is from the nectar of flowers that bees produce honey, which they rely on for food all year round. For thousands of years, humans have also valued honey as a healthy and natural sweetener. Another benefit from bees is that as they collect nectar, they unintentionally perform a particularly important agricultural role: they pollinate crops. Without crop pollination from bees, food supplies for humans would decrease significantly. It is estimated that honeybees pollinate, directly or indirectly, about one-third of the crops in the United States.

For example, think of someone who is learning English and is told to ""break a leg."" What do you think they would understand by that phrase?

Soon, a plant breeding program was underway to improve upon a type of beet that could be used for making sugar. In France and elsewhere, several crude factories sprang up in an attempt to begin producing sugar from the sugar beet. The attempt failed, however, and after the British blockade ended, European sugar production went into steady decline. The ability to extract sugar from the beet, however, had been proven successful, and the new type of sugar production caught on in the United States soon after. In 1879, the first successful commercial sugar beet processing plant in the U.S. began production in Alvarado, California. Over the next four decades, more than 90 sugar beet factories began operating in 18 states. Currently in the U.S., more than 4.5 million tons of sugar are produced annually from sugar beets, which accounts for more than half of domestic sugar production.

The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than human, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry. What is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learnt as a task, but to be assimilated as a part of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind with ever-renewed encouragement.

Nevertheless, U.S. Geological Survey scientists in collaboration with university researchers have developed a method to accurately estimate population size and density for this mysterious felid, the last remaining puma subspecies in eastern North America and one of the most endangered felids worldwide. Researchers used camera trap data to develop a revolutionary spatial capture-recapture model that not only generates statistically reliable density estimates, but does so even when individual animals are not identifiable, as was the case for the Florida panther. The capture-recapture model was used to assist Florida's wildlife managers to collect population data for that portion of the panther's range where the Army Corps of Engineers is rehabilitating a natural habitat that is immediately adjacent to the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, studies show that earth-sheltered houses are more cost-effective in climates that have significant temperature extremes and low humidity, such as those of the Rocky Mountains and northern Great Plains. Earth temperatures vary much less than air temperatures in these areas, which means the earth can absorb extra heat from the house in hot weather or insulate the house to maintain warmth in cold weather. A south-facing slope in a region with moderate to long winters is ideal for an earth-sheltered building. South-facing windows can let in sunlight for direct heating, while the rest of the house is set back into the slope. Careful planning by a designer familiar with earth sheltering can take full advantage of the conditions on your particular site.

Finding and growing the seeds is not easy. Because each species of plant has evolved a genetic makeup specific to the cliffs, valleys and ridges of each of our national parks, the National Park Service (NPS) uses seeds native to that specific park area. Native plants are better able to resist damage from freezing temperatures, drought, common diseases, and grazing animals like elk and deer. The NPS collects a small amount of those specific seeds and provides them to NRCS for propagation. The Plant Materials Center starts the seed in a greenhouse before transplanting it in a nearby field to mature. Each planted seed will end up producing hundreds of seeds for many years. With each harvest, the seeds are processed, bagged and delivered in quantities of tens to hundreds of pounds ready to be planted by the NPS.

Powder coating -- an industrial process that provides a finishing coat for automobiles, domestic appliances, tools, furniture, architectural metal, and other products -- not only lasts a long time, but also looks good. The powder used in powder coating consists mainly of polymer resin, curing agents, color, and leveling agents. These ingredients are mixed together at high heat, cooled, and then ground into a powder. The powder is electrically charged and sprayed onto a grounded metal part. After the part is thoroughly coated with powder, it is sent to a convection oven to be cured, or heat-dried. This final step in the process can take the longest, but it is worth the wait.

Which of the following best describes the steps in preparing the powder, from first to last?

A.	The ingredients are heated, cooled, ground, and mixed.
B.	The ingredients are mixed, heated, cooled, and ground.
C.	The ingredients are ground, mixed, heated, and cooled.

Medieval manuscripts were written on vellum, a paper-like material made out of animal skin. The animal skin had to be prepared, cured, and cut before it could be used. Larger books could require the hides of several cows, sheep, or goats. A scribe would spend months or even years writing the words in the manuscript, using ink made from charcoal or oak galls. After the scribe was finished, the illuminator would add pictures to the text, often using gold leaf and brightly colored paint. This often took even more time than writing the text. The finished manuscript was bound in wooden boards, which served as the manuscript's front and back covers, and were also highly decorated.

Which of the following conclusions about medieval manuscripts is suggested by the passage?

A.	They led to the production of paper.
B.	They were ornate, one-of-a-kind, and valued.
C.	They were cured, assembled, and manufactured by scribes.
D.	They weren't durable, because they were made with animal skin.

Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways -- with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbor, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favorable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.

As far back as 1540, when the Spanish conquistadors came looking for treasure, the Superstition Mountains of Arizona have been rumored to contain vast amounts of gold. The ""Dutchman"" of the mine was actually a German man named Jacob Walz who allegedly rediscovered the mine sometime after 1870. He produced high quality gold nuggets for 20 years, but no one was ever able to find out where he got them. According to legend, he left clues, including ""There is a trick in the trail to my mine,"" and ""The rays of the setting sun shine into the entrance of my mine."" A recent United States Geological Survey (USGS) survey indicates that there are deep-seated mineral deposits in the area. Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Agriculture closed the area to mining in 1983.

Once upon a time a novel of mine was turned into a play. The dramatist who prepared the story for stage production sent me a copy of his efforts. About the only point of resemblance between his production and mine was the fact that they both bore the same title, the hero in each had the same name, and the action in both cases took place on this earth. I was a young author then, and timid. I ventured humbly to enquire why the drama differed so entirely from the novel; and this ingenious, I might almost say ingenuous, explanation was vouchsafed me: ""Well, to tell you the truth, after I had read a chapter or two of your book, I lost it, and I just wrote the play from my own imagination."" I do not wish to criticize the results … but to describe that particular effort as a dramatisation of my book was absurd. Incidentally, it was absurd in other ways and, fortunately for the reputation of both of us, it never saw the light.

Weighing up to 71 grams (about 2 and a half ounces), this insect is about three times heavier than a mouse and is up to four inches in length, not including its legs or antennae (which can be up to twice as long as its body)! Giant wetas are not just big overall, they also have big eyes and large legs covered with large spines that are used for defense. Relative to the size of their head, their jaws are massive -- the scariest insect in the world if you came face-to-face with one. It's known by New Zealand natives, the Maori, as ""the god of ugly things."" You might expect an insect this big to be a meat eater, but it gets the majority of its bulk from large doses of leafy greens. Another interesting thing about this insect is that it was around with the dinosaurs and has evolved very little since then.

Now 550 feet deep and over 4,000 feet wide, the crater is as deep as the Washington Monument is tall. This gouge was created in several dramatic seconds approximately 50,000 years ago when a mostly iron meteorite -- likely no larger than 150 feet in diameter -- crashed into Earth at about 26,000 miles per hour. Despite millennia of rainfall and strong winds, the crater's rim still rises over 150 feet above the surrounding land. Research done here has provided valuable sampling techniques for scientists, which has been crucial in developing criteria for identifying meteor craters internationally. Moreover, the site hosted NASA scientists and astronauts in training exercises that prepared them, by way of simulations, for missions to the moon's surface.

A layer of the canyon's cliffs is porous sandstone, supported by a more impervious rock -- this forces rainwater accumulating in the sandstone out as springs, too numerous to count. Springs of Weeping Rock never dry up. It is a remote, quiet, and meditative place. We were alone there, soaking in the sounds of falling water. Each drop has made a long journey to that moment: hydrologists have tested the water seeping out of Weeping Rock and discovered that it had traveled through sandstone for over a millennium.

They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.

Add a six-inch layer of nitrogen-rich green materials, such as grass clippings and vegetable waste. Then, add water. The pile should be moist, but should not yield any water when squeezed. Continue to alternate layers of carbon and nitrogen materials until your pile is three-to-five feet high. Make sure your pile is neither too wet, nor too compacted. A regular practice of turning the pile will allow for better airflow and drainage. This will produce the most favorable conditions for the bacteria, fungi, and other agents to break down the ingredients of your pile into a rich, decomposed compost.

During this era, establishing a North Pole find was complicated. Planting a marker was futile, as the North Pole lies on a drifting sea of ice. Polar explorers were expected to keep detailed notes documenting their travels. Peary's record was largely accepted until 1988 when the National Geographic Society re-examined Peary's evidence and found he never proved his claim.

According to the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Venus fly trap (Dionaea muscipula), a carnivorous plant native to many countries including the United States, gathers necessary nutrients from soil like most other plants. However, unlike other plants, it also gets nutrients from insects it captures in its fronds. Dionaea muscipula is endemic in sandy, acidic, low-nutrient, boggy soils in a small area of the coastal pine savannah along the border of North and South Carolina. Although a common house plant, Dionaea muscipula is very vulnerable in the wild, due in part to its popularity. Isolated wild populations are illegally harvested, decreasing the genetic diversity and damaging its delicate habitat. To ensure a purchased plant is not wild harvested, make sure it is ""nursery propagated,"" or is one of the popular cultivars such as ""Giant"" or ""Royal Red.""

However, it is as carefully choreographed as classical ballet. To start, the glassblower gets a glob of molten glass on the end of a blowpipe. The glassblower then starts blowing air through the blowpipe to expand the molten glass. Depending on the shape and complexity of the piece, the partially blown glass can be rolled on a flat surface, called a marver, or manipulated with tweezers. Once the shape of the piece is finished, the final critical step is called ""the transfer."" During this step the glass is removed from the original blowpipe to another blowpipe in order to make an opening in the glass. The blown glass is gradually cooled to room temperature to keep it from cracking or breaking. Once cooled, the glass is ""knocked off"" the transferred blowpipe and the glass creation is complete.

According to the passage, what should a glassblower do before rolling the molten glass on a marver?

A.	Gradually cool the glass.
B.	Expand the glob of molten glass.
C.	Manipulate the glass with tweezers.
D.	Remove the glass from the blowpipe.

The foot, therefore, is lifted as in walking, as if to step forward, then the leg is vigorously straightened to a kick, so as to make the bells ring. At the same instant that the forward leg is straightened, a hop is made on the rear foot; the dancer alights upon the toe, but lets the heel follow immediately and firmly. As with the step, so also with the jump; the dancer jumps, roughly, as high as his own foot, holding when in air legs and body straight, alighting upon the toes, but only so as to break the shock sufficiently for comfort, then letting the heels come firmly down. In alighting from the jump, the knees are bent just enough to save the dancer from injurious shock, and are straightened immediately.

Its coloration is rust red to grayish red, and its tail is outlined with a broad black band edged with white. It is an extremely vocal squirrel, chattering, stomping its feet, and scolding to get the visitor to leave. It lives mostly in western forests at middle elevations, eats pine cone seeds for food, and prefers damp and cool areas for its food storage. Chickarees are very territorial and may defend their area by physical combat. They are active during the day and then retire to their nests at night. Nests may be on the ground, in the crotch of trees, or in tree hollows. If you are ever in a forested area in the West, look for these small creatures. It is likely, though, you'll hear one before you see one.

According to the passage, why does the chickaree prefer cool, wet areas?

The true wilderness voyagers are willing to endure some discomforts on the trail, to work hard and submit to black flies and other pests, but as a reward they usually demand satisfying meals. There is, indeed, no reason for them to deny themselves a variety and a plenty, unless the trip is to extend into months. Weight on the portage trail is always the consideration that cuts down the ration. Packing on one's back a ration to be used two or three months hence is discouraging. I have evolved a two-week food supply for two hikers…. It offers not only great variety, but is an exceedingly bountiful ration even for the hungriest. Personal taste will suggest some … substitutions that may be made without material loss or change in weight.

Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar -- except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path.

Saouy was of a quite different character: he was always sullen and morose, and treated everybody after a disrespectful manner, without any regard to their rank or quality; instead of making himself beloved and admired for his riches, he was so perfect a miser, as to deny himself the necessaries of life.

For fortified towns the following general principles are to be observed. First comes the choice of a very healthy site. Such a site will be high, neither misty nor frosty, and in a climate neither hot nor cold, but temperate; further, without marshes in the neighborhood. For when the morning breezes blow toward the town at sunrise, if they bring with them mists from marshes and, mingled with the mist, the poisonous breath of the creatures of the marshes to be wafted into the bodies of the inhabitants, they will make the site unhealthy. Again, if the town is on the coast with a southern or western exposure, it will not be healthy, because in summer the southern sky grows hot at sunrise and is fiery at noon, while a western exposure grows warm after sunrise, is hot at noon, and at evening all aglow.

The main point of the passage is to provide advice about

The Constitution gives certain powers to the federal government and reserves the rest for the states. The federal court system deals with legal issues expressly or implicitly granted to it by the U.S. Constitution. The state court systems deal with their respective state constitutions and the legal issues that the U.S. Constitution did not give to the federal government or explicitly deny to the states. For example, because the Constitution gives Congress sole authority to make uniform laws concerning bankruptcies, a state court would lack jurisdiction. Likewise, since the Constitution does not give the federal government authority in most family law matters, a federal court would lack jurisdiction in a divorce case.

It was Nollekens, the sculptor, who said that he frequently saw Hogarth sauntering round Leicester Square … ""with his master's sickly child hanging its head over his shoulder."" That was in the early days, when he was still serving his time to Gamble, and not even dreaming, I suppose, that he would one day own the big house at the south-east corner of the Square, would enjoy some of his highest triumphs and sharpest humiliations in it, and die in it at last, leaving behind him work that would give him a place among the very first of English painters.

Mr. Buller and Mr. Podington were old friends and each was the best friend which the other had in this world. But during all these years neither of them had visited the other in his country home. The reason for this is that Mr. Buller's country house was situated by the sea, and he was very fond of the water. But Mr. Podington was desperately afraid of the water, and he was particularly afraid of any craft sailed by an amateur. If his friend Buller would have employed a professional mariner, of years and experience, to steer his boat, Podington might have been willing to take an occasional sail; but as Buller always insisted upon sailing his own boat, and took it ill if any of his visitors doubted his ability to do so properly, Podington did not wish to wound the self-love of his friend, and he did not wish to be drowned. Consequently he could not bring himself to consent to go to Buller's house by the sea.

All things considered, the most remarkable figure [of the 18th century] was that of the great Johann Sebastian Bach…. It is scarcely too much to say that this great man has exercised more influence upon the development of music than any other composer who has ever lived. In his own day he led a quiet, uneventful life, at first as student, then as court musician at Weimar, where he played the violin; later as organist at Arnstadt, a small village near Weimar, and still later as director of music in the St. Thomas church and school at Leipzig. In the sixty-five years of his life, Bach produced an enormous number of compositions, of which about half were in fugue form, a form which was at its prime at the beginning of this century and which Bach carried to the farthest point in the direction of freedom and spontaneity which it ever reached.

The Horse Protection Act (HPA) is a Federal law that prohibits horses subjected to a practice called soring (inflicting pain in training to force behaviors) from participating in shows, sales, exhibitions, or auctions. The Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service works actively with the horse industry to protect against such abuse to ensure that only sound and healthy horses participate in shows. Soring is a cruel and abusive practice used to accentuate a horse's gait. It may be accomplished by irritating or blistering a horse's forelegs through the application of chemicals or the use of mechanical devices. Walking horses are known for possessing a naturally high gait, but in order to be successful in competition their natural gait is often exaggerated. The exaggerated gait can be achieved with proper training and considerable time; however, some horse exhibitors, owners, and trainers have chosen to use improper and inhumane training methods to shorten that time through abusive practices.

All philosophers, of every school, imagine that causation is one of the fundamental axioms or postulates of science, yet, oddly enough, in advanced sciences such as gravitational astronomy, the word ""cause"" never occurs. Dr. James Ward, in his Naturalism and Agnosticism, makes this a ground of complaint against physics: the business of those who wish to ascertain the ultimate truth about the world, he apparently thinks, should be the discovery of causes, yet physics never even seeks them. To me it seems that philosophy ought not to assume such legislative functions, and that the reason why physics has ceased to look for causes is that, in fact, there are no such things. The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm.

What the stars are for, what they are like when you get there, I do not know; but a starry night would not be so beautiful if it were simply meant as a warning to some unpleasant financier that Kaffirs were going up. Ordinary people look up and think what insignificant atoms they are beneath the heavens; the believers in astrology look up and realize afresh their overwhelming importance. Perhaps, after all, I am glad I do not believe.

Many bountiful crops would not occur without the work of pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, birds, and bats. Every year, more than $15 billion in U.S. crops are pollinated by bees alone. Honeybees are good pollinators for many reasons. Their furry bodies trap pollen to carry it to other plants, and the size and shape of their bodies allow pollination among a wide variety of plants. Additionally, they spend most of their lives gathering nectar and pollen to take back to the hive to feed the colony. Apples, blueberries, cherries, watermelon, cantaloupe, pumpkin, and onions are all foods that are pollinated by bees to produce fruit or seeds. To ensure our food supply, we must do everything we can to keep our pollinators healthy.

Based on the passage, the author's main point is

A.	honeybees are highly successful pollinators.
B.	most crops require some work from pollinators.
C.	the work of pollinators is essential to our food supply.

Hope and the future for me are not in cultivated fields, not in towns and cities, but in the impervious and quaking swamps. When, formerly, I have analyzed my partiality for some farm which I had contemplated purchasing, I have frequently found that I was attracted solely by a few square rods of impermeable and unfathomable bog. That was the jewel which dazzled me. I derive more of my subsistence from the swamps which surround my native town than from the cultivated gardens in the village. … I often think that I should like to have my house front on this mass of dull red bushes, omitting other flower plots and borders, transplanted spruce and trim box, even graveled walks. Why not put my house, my parlor, behind this plot, instead of behind that meager assemblage of curiosities, that poor apology for a Nature and Art, which I call my front yard?

The sand really is jet black: remnants of lava shattered as it touched the ocean -- you will only see such sand on ""young"" volcanic islands. Unlike the white sand beaches that get replenished by coral-munching fish, this beach has no source of renewal. This is not a swimmer's paradise: the water is cold from icy freshwater springs just offshore. ""Punalu'u"" means ""diving spring."" In the old days, people would plunge to the bay's floor to gather drinking water. A legend is attached to the springs: Kauila, the turtle goddess, is its patron. Alternating between her turtle and human forms, she is said to have watched over local children playing on this beach. Turtles remain a big part of the place. Endangered green sea turtles, the honu, come here to feed on the lava rock algae and play in the waves. They remain the patrons of the beach.

Like his contemporaries, van Gogh was interested in creating ""the modern portrait,"" focusing less on likeness and more on the sitter's inner world, expressed through color. Many of van Gogh's portraits are self-portraits, painted at the most pivotal moments of his troubled life. My favorite portrait series, though, is of the Roulin family…. Joseph Roulin was a local postman, who quickly became van Gogh's close friend. Joseph, his wife Augustine, and their three children were painted repeatedly, focusing especially on the couple's pride after the birth of their daughter Marcelle. Intensely lonely at the time, van Gogh saw in the Roulins the warmth and vitality he so missed. The Roulin portraits are not obviously joyful, but there is a light in them, a timelessness that recalls the poised paintings of saints -- at once distant and humble -- set against vibrant backgrounds that seem to breathe and, as van Gogh intended, to comfort.

Referred to as ""Code Talkers,"" members of many Native tribes used their languages to transmit secret orders and battlefield information across enemy lines. In the 1940s, hundreds of Native Americans were deployed to the European, Pacific, and North African fronts as communication specialists, creating complex codes that helped save thousands of American and allied lives. Their work was highly classified, so they were met with no recognition when they returned home, many to impoverished communities and states that denied Native Americans the right to vote well into the 1950s. Only recently are their achievements being widely acknowledged: In 1989, the French government was the first to honor the Comanche Code Talkers with one of its highest military medals, and the U.S. finally honored the Navajo Code Talkers in 2000.

They flew old crop-dusters made of plywood and canvas, with open cockpits, and nothing but maps and a compass to guide them. In stealth mode, the women had to still the engines and glide towards their targets, creating the ""woosh"" sound that Nazi soldiers associated with witches' brooms -- Nachthexen, they called them, the ""Night Witches.""

The canvas seems to shimmer and spin with movement. A little more than a year before he painted this image, van Gogh wrote to his friend and fellow artist, ""I often feel very sorry that I cannot induce myself to work more at home, from imagination. Imagination is surely a faculty that one should develop; for it alone enables us to create a more inspiring and comforting world than we can apprehend by means of a fleeting glance at reality. … How glad I should be one day to try to paint the starry heavens as also a meadow studded with dandelions in the sunlight."" Starry Night, with its dandelion stars and the view of the village drawn from memory as van Gogh recuperated at an asylum from a nervous breakdown, marks the artist's turn toward more imaginative subjects.

I knew that age well; I belonged to it. … I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions. … But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.

Yet a considerable number of these terrifying weapons, pincers, hooks, saws, pikes, augers, screws, rollers, and dentilated teeth, -- the formidable arsenal which gives them the appearance of veterans setting out for the battlefield, -- prove, if we examine them rightly, to be the pacific tools with which they gain their livelihood, the implements with which they do their regular work. Here the artisans carry their workshop with them. They are at once the worker and the manufacturer. The insect, as we shall hereafter see, is a warrior through circumstances, through the necessities of self-defense or appetite, but generally it is before all and above all industrial.

Lime cannot take the place of nitrogen, nor phosphorus, nor any other of the essential plant foods. It is not a substitute for any other essential factor in plant growth. It would be folly to try to depend upon lime as a sole source of soil fertility. On the other hand, we have learned very definitely within the last quarter of a century that it is foolish to depend upon commercial fertilizers and tillage and good seeds for full production of most crops from great areas of our farming country that have a marked lime deficiency. The obvious need of our soils is the rich organic matter that clover and grass sods could furnish, and their fundamental need is lime. Most farms cannot possibly make full returns to their owners until the land's hunger for lime has been met. The only question is that regarding the best way of meeting it.

It is not impossible that in the minds of some persons the idea of employing gentle measures in the management and training of children may seem to imply the abandonment of the principle of authority, as the basis of the parental government, and the substitution of some weak and inefficient system of artifice and maneuvering in its place. To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design. The only government of the parent over the child that is worthy of the name is one of authority -- complete, absolute, unquestioned authority. The object of this work is, accordingly, not to show how the gentle methods … can be employed as a substitute for such authority, but how they can be made to aid in establishing and maintaining it.

On December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orville Wright piloted an aircraft, the Flyer, for a 12-second sustained flight -- the first recorded successful piloted flight of an airplane in history. Orville and his brother Wilbur had spent several years developing crafts for flight. Their journey began in 1899, when they started their research by collecting reference material from various sources. They learned that many people had attempted flight (and how they attempted it) but little progress had been made by those who tried. Based on the reference materials they found, the Wrights eventually designed their first aircraft, a small glider flown as a kite. In 1900, the Wrights flew a glider with a seventeen-foot wingspan and a wing-warping solution for flight control. In 1901, they flew an even larger glider with landing gear. However, the wings did not have enough power, and the glider lacked control. To find a solution, they built a wind tunnel to test wing shapes and lift.

The jaws of great white sharks hold up to 300 serrated teeth at any one time. Though not the fastest in the ocean, they are nevertheless powerful swimmers with tails that can propel them at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour. However, their role as one of the ocean's top hunters has much to do with their highly developed senses. Their most acute sense is smell -- great whites can detect even tiny amounts of blood in the water over a mile away. They also have highly refined senses of hearing, touch, taste, and sight. They even have organs that can sense electromagnetic fields from other animals.

According to the passage, one reason the great white is a top predator is that it can

A.	smell blood at a great distance.
B.	produce electromagnetic fields.
C.	swim faster than any other creature.
D.	bite its prey with different kinds of teeth.

The result is that prices rise rapidly and sharply, followed by an abrupt decline in both price and demand. One of the first recorded and most well-known speculative financial bubbles was tulip mania, or ""tulpenwoede,"" that took place during a period in 17th century Holland when the prices for tulip bulbs reached extreme heights and then suddenly collapsed. Just before the crash, one rare tulip bulb, 'Semper Augustus,' was valued at the approximate cost of a luxurious house in Amsterdam. Another rare tulip bulb called the 'Viceroy' could be exchanged for four oxen, twelve sheep, or one thousand pounds of cheese. The Dutch tulip market reached a climax in early 1637, after the bulbs had been planted. As the flowers neared the spring bloom, the price structure collapsed and the market crashed.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

A.	Financial bubbles are rare.
B.	Irrational speculation ends badly.
C.	High-priced products create speculation.
D.	Agricultural products are poor investments.

Born in 1889 to struggling vaudeville performers, Chaplin's early life was filled with economic hardship and perseverance. Although it didn't offer much pay, at age 10 he landed a short stint as a clog dancer to help make ends meet, and also to follow his dream of acting. A few years later, when he was 12, he got his first stage-acting job as a pageboy in a production of Sherlock Holmes. ""So, between jobs I would polish my shoes, brush my clothes, put on a clean collar and make periodic calls at a theatrical agency."" When Chaplin turned eighteen, he joined a pantomime troupe, where he played an inebriate in the comedic sketch, ""A Night in an English Music Hall."" The character captured the eye of Mack Sennett of Keystone Studios. In his first short film, Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914), Chaplin distinguished himself with a small mustache, baggy pants, worn coat, bowler hat, and oversized shoes -- The Little Tramp was born.

The passage suggests that Charlie Chaplin's acting career was

A.	the result of overcoming numerous setbacks.
B.	a product of talent and hard work.
C.	unsophisticated, but memorable.

We received four direct reports of unidentified flying objects: two separate incidents of a luminous orb, a hovering red light, and an oblong metallic craft. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, the luminous orb was found to be caused by a car dealership's promotional spotlight. Also, the red light was part of a radio tower, and the oblong craft was a blimp. Although these potential alien-encounter incidents were easily debunked, do not get discouraged! There are billions of stars with Earth-size planets and hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. Surely we are not alone! At our next meeting, we will discuss ways to distinguish between U.F.O.s and I.F.O.s -- Identifiable Flying Objects. Keep watching the skies and see you all next month!

Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump.

Corresponding to the supposed duality of matter and mind, there are, in orthodox psychology, two ways of knowing what exists. One of these, the way of sensation and external perception, is supposed to furnish data for our knowledge of matter, the other, called ""introspection,"" is supposed to furnish data for knowledge of our mental processes. To common sense, this distinction seems clear and easy. When you see a friend coming along the street, you acquire knowledge of an external, physical fact; when you realize that you are glad to meet him, you acquire knowledge of a mental fact. Your dreams and memories and thoughts, of which you are often conscious, are mental facts, and the process by which you become aware of them SEEMS to be different from sensation.

According to the passage, which of the following is supposed to furnish data for knowledge of our mental processes?

Born to a working-class family of West Hills, New York in 1819, Whitman is considered part of the first generation of American-born citizens. The allure of the new world was an evident attraction throughout Whitman's life. At the young age of twelve, Whitman fell in love with literature, and in 1831 became an apprentice for a Long Island, New York newspaper. The apprenticeship gave Whitman his first publishing experience, and his first signed article was published only three years later, in 1834. In 1836, at the young age of 17, Whitman began working as a schoolteacher. He taught at various Long Island schools for five years. Then, in 1841, he turned to a full-time career in journalism. It was not until 1855 that Whitman published his first poetry collection, a collection that is widely read today.

Settled by Greeks in the 8th century BC, Pompeii kept growing in popularity until it had spas, factories, shops, cafes, bathhouses, and an arena that could seat 20,000 people. But on a summer morning in 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted, sending massive amounts of ash high into the air. As the powdery volcanic ash drifted back down to earth, it buried everything in Pompeii under millions of tons of ash. Centuries later, in 1748, explorers began digging out Pompeii, and found an almost perfectly preserved city. This moment in time of Roman life looked almost as it did 2,000 years ago.

But one who, in opposition to the people, becomes a prince by the favor of the nobles, ought, above everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favors.

The music of Rimsky-Korsakov is like one of the books, full of gleeful pictures, which are given to children. It is perhaps the most brilliant of them all, a picture-book illuminated in crude and joyous colors -- bright reds, apple greens, golden oranges and yellows -- and executed with genuine verve and fantasy. The personages in the pictures are arrayed in bizarre and shimmering costumes, delightfully inaccurate; and if they represent kings and queens, are set in the midst of a fabulous pomp and glitter. Framing the illustrations are border-fancies of sunflowers and birds, fashioned boisterously and humorously in the manner of Russian peasant art. Indeed, the book is executed so charmingly that the parents find it as amusing as do the children.

Which of the following literary techniques does the author use in the passage?

A.	simile

Showy in its bright-orange bloom and vigorous even in the driest of soils, butterflyweed (Asclepias tuberosa, named after Asklepios, the Greek god of healing, in recognition of the plant's many folk-medicine properties) is one of the most useful plants in my garden. Part of the milkweed family, this is a host plant for monarch butterflies and a popular nectar source for many June pollinators. Monarch butterfly larvae rely exclusively on members of the milkweed family to survive, and it is the chemical in the plant's leaves that makes the monarchs distasteful and poisonous to predators. In early fall, a generation of monarchs is born called the Methuselah generation, which travels thousands of miles from across the eastern United States and Canada to forests in central Mexico. The Methuselah can live up to nine months, instead of the usual 2 to 5 weeks -- they travel south, overwinter, and then head home in spring. By growing butterflyweed, you can contribute to this grand North American migration.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	advise on proper butterflyweed care.
B.	promote butterflyweed among gardeners.
C.	explain the monarchs' reliance on butterflyweed.
D.	protect monarchs from the poisonous butterflyweed.

The idea of presenting medicine in candy form is really very old. The term confection, which originally meant a medicinal compound being derived from the Latin word ""conficere,"" to put together, has been applied since the days of classical antiquity to mixtures of medicinal substances with saccharine matter. The only official relics of this once very extensive class of preparations are the confection of rose and the confection of senna; both of which, however, are also practically obsolete. The reason for this is not difficult to find. Neither of them come up to our modern ideas of a confection. We may officially call them a confection, but a youngster would be disrespectful enough to disagree with the pharmacopoeia.

Here I slackened pace, for I drank the spicy, resiny wind, and beneath the arms of this noble tree I felt that I was safely home. Never did pine trees seem so dear. How sweet was their breath and their song, and how grandly they winnowed the sky!

The pit's glow and sulfurous smell spread for miles, drawing steady caravans of photographers and adventurers. Hours away from the closest settlement, this place feels like the edge of the world. It seems ancient, ageless, extraordinary. Its actual beginnings were quite prosaic: In 1971, geologists arrived in the small village of Derweze (meaning ""door,"" the simple inspiration for the pit's name), looking for natural gas. As they drilled, they stumbled on a cavern that collapsed the floor under the rig. Toxic fumes began to leak, threatening the village. The geologists set the pit on fire, thinking that this would quickly burn off the gas. Almost half a century later, the village is gone, but the flames continue to burn. Turkmenistan's president ordered the pit to be filled, but, for now, The Door remains untouched -- a thrilling, eerie symbol of human folly.

The sun shone warm, the air was balmy; everywhere, where it did not get scraped away, the grass revived and sprang up between the paving-stones as well as on the narrow strips of lawn on the boulevards. The birches, the poplars, and the wild cherry unfolded their gummy and fragrant leaves, the limes were expanding their opening buds; crows, sparrows, and pigeons, filled with the joy of spring, were getting their nests ready; the flies were buzzing along the walls, warmed by the sunshine.

I know what evil is.

For the very reason that I have come in contact with it, I am more truly an optimist. I can say with conviction that the struggle which evil necessitates is one of the greatest blessings. It makes us strong, patient, helpful men and women. It lets us into the soul of things and teaches us that although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcoming of it. My optimism, then, does not rest on the absence of evil, but on a glad belief in the preponderance of good and a willing effort always to cooperate with the good, that it may prevail.… The world is sown with good; but unless I turn my glad thoughts into practical living and till my own field, I cannot reap a kernel of the good.

This was the first instance of creating light by use of an electric current. In 1820, Warren De la Rue encased a platinum coil in an evacuated tube and passed an electric current through it, resulting in the first electric light bulb. It worked well, but the cost of platinum made De la Rue's invention commercially impossible. Over the next several decades, inventors tried numerous light bulb designs. In 1874, Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans filed a patent for a lamp of carbon rods mounted in a nitrogen-filled glass cylinder, but could not commercialize it. Thomas Edison bought their patent in 1879 and developed a carbon filament that lasted 13.5 hours.

I put this mass into a crucible, and kept it in a coal fire, red-hot, till it became reduced to a porous black charcoal. On urging the heat with a pair of bellows, and stirring the mass in the crucible with the stem of a tobacco-pipe, it became, after two hours' exposure to an intense heat, converted into a greyish-white ash; but no metal could be discriminated amongst it. I now poured upon it some aqua fortis, which dissolved nearly the whole of it, with an effervescence; and produced, after having been suffered to stand, to let the insoluble portion subside, a bright grass-green solution, of a strong metallic taste; after immersing into this solution the blade of a knife, it became instantly covered with a bright coat of copper.

Imagined and advanced by Picasso and Georges Braque who met in 1907, Cubism reduced objects into geometric forms and cubic abstractions. But by 1912, as the works of Picasso and Braque became increasingly abstract and less identifiable based on their titles, Picasso began to glue colored or printed pieces of paper onto the surface of his paintings. This collage technique represented the second phase of the Cubist style: Synthetic Cubism. After World War I, Picasso experimented less with Cubism; instead, he began using multiple styles within a single painting, drawing on Neoclassicism, Surrealism, Expressionism, and Cubism. Creating, evolving, combining, and even transcending artistic movements, Picasso produced over 20,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, ceramics, and theater pieces to become one of the most important artists of the 20th century.

These labels explain how children should use the toy and for which ages the toy is safe. You should also consider the size of the toy and its parts. Both should be larger than the child's mouth. Don't buy toys with parts that can be removed, like a doll's eyes or buttons. These are choking hazards. Additionally, before you go toy shopping it's a good idea to check the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's website for a list of recalled toys.

Astronomical winter starts on or around December 22 with the winter solstice and ends on or around March 21 with the vernal equinox. Astronomical seasons are based on the positions of the earth and sun, while meteorological seasons are based on the annual temperature cycles.

Start with your breathing and your heartbeat, and then focus on the sounds going on around you. Another tip is to count sounds. Lift your fingers for each sound you hear using your left hand for natural sounds and your right hand for human-made sounds. You can also bring focus to listening by determining which sounds are your favorite and which are your least favorite. With practice, you can discover noises you may never have thought you've heard before, even though they've been going on all around you.

Based on the passage, which type of focusing techniques uses the hands?

A.	counting sounds
B.	picking favorites
C.	feeling your breath
D.	counting heartbeats

Leaf complexity refers to whether a leaf is simple or compound. Simple leaves have only one leaf blade and they may or may not be attached to the stem with a stalk, or petiole. Compound leaves have more than one leaf blade and may have a complex stalk structure. Leaf arrangement is described by the pattern in which the leaves are attached to a stem or twig. There are alternate, opposite, and whorled patterns. The overall shape of a leaf can also be very helpful when trying to identify a tree. There are several types of shapes, including elliptical, linear, and obovate. Identifying these and other leaf characteristics can move you one step closer to determining tree type.

According to the passage, which of the following terms refers to a leaf's shape?

A.	linear
B.	whorled
C.	alternate
D.	elliptical

A pair of white-breasted kingfishers at work during the early stages of nest construction affords an interesting spectacle. Not being able to obtain a foothold on the almost perpendicular surface of the bank, the birds literally charge this in turn with fixed beak. By a succession of such attacks at one spot a hole of an appreciable size is soon formed in the soft sand. Then the birds are able to obtain a foothold and to excavate with the bill, while clinging to the edge of the hole. Every now and then they indulge in a short respite from their labors. While thus resting one of the pair will sometimes spread its wings for an instant and display the white patch; then it will close them and make a neat bow, as if to say ""Is not that nice?"" Its companion may remain motionless and unresponsive, or may return the compliment.

According to the passage, what do the birds do when starting to build their nests?

A.	dig holes with their talons
B.	securely attach to the bank's surface
C.	gain a foothold and use their bills to dig
D.	attack the bank with their beaks to create a foothold

One autumn some correspondence appeared lamenting the scarcity of small birds (and again in the spring the same cry was raised); people said that they had walked along the roads or footpaths and there were none in the hedges. They were quite correct -- the birds were not in the hedges, they were in the corn and stubble. After the nesting is well over and the wheat is ripe the birds leave the hedges and go out into the wheat fields; at the same time the sparrows quit the house-tops and gardens and do the same. At the very time this complaint was raised, the stubbles in Surrey, as I can vouch, were crowded with small birds. If you walked across the stubble flocks of hundreds rose out of your way; if you leant on a gate and watched a few minutes you could see small flocks in every quarter of the field rising and settling again.

According to the passage, why were people unable to see the small birds in autumn?

A.	The birds had migrated to Surrey.
B.	The people were looking in the wrong place.
C.	The people were looking for the birds too late in the season.
D.	The hedges no longer provided adequate protection for the birds.

No archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill and cunning as his, nor were there ever such yeomen as the seven score merry men that roamed with him through the greenwood shades. Right merrily they dwelled within the depths of Sherwood Forest, suffering neither care nor want, but passing the time in merry games of archery or bouts of cudgel play, living upon the King's venison, washed down with draughts of ale of October brewing.

Beautiful stained glass windows can be seen in cathedrals dating back to the middle ages; however, the use of colored glass may be much older and may have originated with the Romans, who used pieces of colored glass in their window frames. Glass, in its most basic form, is made out of melted sand mixed with wood ash; the purer the sand and ash, the clearer the glass. If mineral impurities are present in either the sand or the ash, the result is color in the glass. Glassmakers noticed this and started experimenting with adding different substances during the glassmaking process to consistently get the colors they wanted. Cobalt oxide would produce stunning blue glass, whereas copper oxides produced either greens or reds. When stained glass was used to create pictures, artists would create shading and details with paint made from crushed glass and copper mixed with wine.

Based on the passage, what substances did stained glass artists use to produce shading?

A.	cobalt and copper oxides
B.	sand mixed with wood ash

It is a screen built at a period different from, and, we may now safely assume, later than, that of the nave, and built for the exhibition of a noble legend in stone, which has ever since been the glory of a county famed for its splendid churches.

The production of scents is divided into four distinct operations -- expression, distillation, maceration, and absorption. Distillation -- The plant that contains the odoriferous principle, is placed in a pan and covered with water; to the pan a dome-shaped lid is fitted, terminating with a pipe, and fixed in a bucket, with the end peeping out like a tap in a barrel. The water in the still is made to boil; and having no other exit, the steam must pass through the coiled pipe; which, being surrounded with cold water in the bucket, condenses the vapor before it can arrive at the tap. With the steam, the volatile oils -- i.e. perfume -- rises, and is liquefied at the same time. The liquids which thus run over, on standing for a time, separate into two portions, and are finally divided with a funnel having a stopcock in the narrow part of it. By this process, the majority of the volatile or essential oils are procured.

Which of the following best describes distilling plant oils, from first to last?

A.	plant is covered with water, steam is liquefied, water is boiled, oil is collected

Some heads were bowed upon folded arms, some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious music; the flies buzzed and bit, unmolested, the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes, and pattered about, and made themselves at home everywhere; and one of them sat up like a squirrel on the king's head and held a bit of cheese in its hands and nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the king's face with naive and impudent irreverence.

Her challenge, L'Epistre au Dieu d'Amours, took the form of an address to the God of Love, professing to come from women of all conditions, imploring Cupid's aid against disloyal and deceitful lovers, whose base behavior she largely attributes to the false teaching of these two books.

In the manual, Leonardo describes an experiment in which immersing one's face in a bowl of water optically neutralizes the cornea -- the basic function of the contact lens. Unfortunately, Leonardo himself would not live to see his simple experiment emerge as the basis of one of the most popular methods for correcting vision. In fact, it wasn't until 1823 -- over 300 years later -- that British astronomer Sir John Herschel conceptualized a potential design for lenses that were practical.

It was developed in the city of Edo (now Tokyo) during the Tokugawa or Edo Period (1615-1868). Although Ukiyo-e was initially considered ""low"" art, by and for the non-elite classes, its artistic and technical caliber is consistently remarkable. Understanding and interpreting the Ukiyo-e images demands a high level of visual, textual, and cultural literacy. From its earliest days, Ukiyo-e images and texts frequently referred to themes from classical, literary, and historical sources. At the same time, Ukiyo-e constantly expanded to reflect contemporary tastes, concerns, and innovations over the two and a half centuries of its development. The result was an art that was both populist (of and for the people, readily accessible, plentiful, affordable) and highly sophisticated. In summary, Ukiyo-e presented both the historical and all that was current, fashionable, chic, and popular.

This ancient bristlecone pine has lived almost 5,000 years and predates the Egyptian pyramids. The Methuselah Tree is located in California's Inyo National Forest, which is close to 10,000 feet above sea level, not an ideal environment for flora to survive, let alone thrive. Despite this cold, dry and altogether unforgiving environment, Methuselah and the other ancient bristlecone pines found there have proved to be remarkably adaptable to the hostile conditions, a quality that has kept them alive over several millennia. The oldest known individual tree is also a bristlecone pine and lives within the same mountain range as Methuselah. This unnamed tree is said to be over 5,000 years old.

Based on the passage, the Methuselah tree is

A.	in an ideal environment for flora.

Legend has it that a sumo match between the Shinto gods Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata determined the origin of the Japanese islands. Sumo thus developed into a religious ritual in ancient Japan that many believed would ensure a good harvest. By 700 AD, sumo matches were conducted during ceremonies of the imperial court and sumo festivals were held annually, becoming lavish events that also featured music and dancing. Over time, sumo became an increasingly strict discipline with clearly defined rules and techniques that form the basis of the popular sport we know today. While sumo wrestling is currently more popular than ever, many purists in Japan resent its rapid and uncontrolled globalization -- namely, the introduction of modern elements, such as non-dirt rings, weight classes, contemporary attire, etc. -- and continue to fight against the erosion of its time-honored traditions.

Based on the passage, some believe that the internationalization of sumo wrestling comes at the expense of

A.	the culture's folklore.

The refuge's establishment highlights the importance of land conservation in an area dominated by industrial logging and agriculture, and provides the potential for additional land protection. The Strategic Air Command was stationed at the base from 1950 to 1994, flying long-range bombers capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Caribou Air Force Station located in the northeast corner of the site served as a top-secret, self-contained nuclear weapons storage base. What was once a strategic military base for half of a century has now been restored to an ecologically diverse assemblage of federally protected lands. Extensive restoration of the site began immediately after its establishment, including the demolition of military buildings and cleanup of contaminated soils. The refuge manages lands to conserve and protect a diversity of wildlife habitats and species.

Prior to the battle it was comparatively unknown to the outside world, save to those interested in the Lutheran College and Theological Seminary here located. From year to year it pursued the even and quiet tenor of an inland town, with nothing to vary the monotony but the annual exercises of the above-named institutions. On these occasions the influx of strangers, for the short period of commencement week, did add some stir and life to the place, but only to have it settle into more irksome quietude after the visitors had left. Today Gettysburg is a changed place. A new spirit and enterprise have taken hold of its inhabitants, and evidence of modern progress is everywhere manifest. Scarcely a day passes that does not witness some pilgrimage to this Mecca of human freedom.

The truth is, all alligators are crocodiles in that they belong to the order Crocodylia. Under this order are three families: Alligatoridae, which includes alligators; Crocodylidae, which includes ""true"" crocodiles; and the lesser known Gavialidae, which consists of only one species, the gharial, a native of India. Of course, alligator species have distinguishing characteristics. It's true that an alligator's teeth are not visible when its mouth is closed, unlike some crocodile species. Alligators also have shorter, wider heads. Perhaps what makes alligators stand out the most, however, is their preference for freshwater over saltwater. Alligators live in rivers, lakes, and other small bodies of water that tend to be close to where people live. In the state of Florida especially, you may see alligators in parks, backyards, and pools!

Mr. Alfred Thipps was a small, nervous man, whose flaxen hair was beginning to abandon the unequal struggle with destiny. One might say that his only really marked feature was a large bruise over the left eyebrow, which gave him a faintly dissipated air incongruous with the rest of his appearance. Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter's thoughtfulness and condescension in calling. ""I'm sure it's most kind of your lordship,"" he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids.

During winter, the polar jet stream transports cold Arctic air southward across the plains of Canada and the United States and eastward toward the Atlantic Ocean, as warm air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic tries to move northward. The warm waters of the Gulf Stream help keep the coastal waters relatively mild during the winter, which in turn helps warm the cold winter air over the water. This difference in temperature between the warm air over the water and cold Arctic air over the land is the area where nor'easters are born.

Others hold that this comma is unnecessary and redundant because the conjunction itself essentially acts as a comma. Thus, the list should be written ""red, white and blue.""

This semaphore, a tall post with two movable arms that extended horizontally to indicate ""stop,"" helped pedestrians cross the street during horse-drawn traffic jams. At night, when it was difficult to see the arms, a gas light on top of the semaphore burned green for ""go"" and red for ""stop.""

However, doing so can be dangerous, for it leaves you vulnerable to identity thieves and other malicious hackers. Many identity thieves use sophisticated programs that can generate passwords using personal information and are capable of thousands of login attempts per hour. A good rule of thumb: If your password is easy to remember or too short, then it's probably not strong enough. The best and most secure passwords are long -- the difference between a nine-character password and a 10-character password is more significant than you might think. In addition, use a variety of lower and upper case letters, numbers and symbols, and be sure to change your passwords often.

The old American who writes this introduction has hope and faith in our younger generation and hence is rejoiced to see a powerful story, powerfully told, put into the hands of our young people. American youth, old enough to read this narrative of magnificent bravery, are not far from the age when on them will be laid the tremendous moral responsibility of being citizens and defenders of a democracy. They need to be prepared for this responsibility by anything which can be learned from our history. Many of the stories written for them describe how other people have bravely and persistently resisted such dangers. But the collective life of human communities also is threatened by special dangers, and, to resist them, courage and determination are as much needed as in personal trials.

Beginning in 1754, when Benjamin Franklin's ""Join or Die"" cartoon appeared in the Pennsylvania Gazette, political cartoonists have long used their skills to praise, attack, caricature, lampoon, and otherwise express their opinions on the most urgent issues of the day. Drawing political cartoons began as a street-level phenomenon, and in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, they were often posted on walls or passed from person to person. At the end of the nineteenth century, they were an important part of the growing popularity of newspapers and magazines, and the intense competition for readership made provocative cartoons a valuable selling point.

Indeed, the Smilodon was a saber-toothed cat, but it wasn't the only animal -- or even cat -- in history with long, ferocious saber teeth. Such deadly canine fangs, which extended well past the animal's jaw, were found in many mammalian families, including South American marsupials and the extinct Nimravidae, a mammal related to cats, mongooses, and civets. However, popular imagination places the Smilodon alongside Tyrannosaurus rex at the top of iconic predators.

Pangaea covered nearly one third of Earth's surface, and an enormous ocean ""Panthalassa,"" covered the rest. Over hundreds of millions of years, Pangaea split to form the continents and oceans as we now know them. The fragmentation of Pangaea is explained by plate tectonics theory, which holds that Earth's outer shell is divided into a series of plates. The movement of the plates is driven by convection of the molten rock beneath Earth's crust. Scientists have shown that the plates -- and therefore all the continents -- continue to move a few centimeters every year.

The reason of the popularity of this poetry may be summed up in the words -- it pictures human life. For nature worship or classic lore, ethics or abstruse philosophy, grow stale and flat when used continually as the basis of literary emotions, but every human being, who has not become a conventionalized fossil, always will be moved by the passions of the surging, restless, primitive, spirit of humanity that permeates Robert Service's poems. These poems must not be regarded as typically Canadian -- they crystallize a phase of Canadian life, but it is a phase which has become Canadian by accident of circumstances. The rhythm of the poems has an irresistible sweep; no training in the technique of versification is necessary to catch the movement -- it carries one away; and the plain, forcible language grips the attention and holds it, while short, vivid, insistent epithets hammer themselves deeply into one's mind.

And yet, on the other hand, unless wariness be used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book. Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself. A good book is the precious life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life. Revolutions of ages do not oft recover the loss of a rejected truth, for the want of which whole nations fare the worse.

According to the passage, books should not be destroyed because

A.	destroying them is like killing a person.
B.	it is the same as destroying human reason.
C.	they are like living creatures who cannot protect themselves.

Before beginning to decorate a room it is essential to consider for what purpose the room is to be used. The tastes and habits of the people who are to occupy it must be taken into account; it must be not ""a drawing-room,"" but the drawing-room best suited to the master or mistress of the house. Individuality consists not in an attempt to be different from other people at the cost of comfort, but in the desire to be comfortable in one's own way, even though it be the way of a monotonously large majority. It seems easier to most people to arrange a room like someone else's than to analyze and express their own needs.

According to the passage, when decorating a room, people should

A.	be as imaginative as possible.
B.	always choose function over comfort.
C.	avoid turning them into drawing-rooms.
D.	express their tastes, however ordinary they may be.

Not louder does the tempestuous sea bellow when the north wind strikes its foaming waves between Scylla and Charybdis; nor when the fiery caverns of Mount Etna, spitting forth the element which it cannot restrain, hurl it back to the place whence it issued, driving furiously before it any obstacle in the way of its vehement fury -- so I, urged by my great desire and longing to see the blending of strange and various shapes made by creating nature, wandered for some time among the dark rocks, and came to the entrance of a great cave, in front of which I long stood in astonishment and ignorance. And after having remained there some time, two things arose within me, fear and desire, -- fear of the dark and threatening cave, desire to see whether there were anything marvelous within.

We say abstractly: ""I mean to enjoy poetry. I fully intend to keep up my love of music, to read the books that shall give new turns to the thought of my time, to keep my higher spiritual side alive, etc."" But we do not attack these things concretely, and we do not begin today. We forget that every good that is worth possessing must be paid for in strokes of daily effort. We postpone and postpone, until those smiling possibilities are gone. Whereas ten minutes a day of poetry, of spiritual reading or meditation, and an hour or two a week at music or philosophy, provided we began now and suffered no remission, would infallibly give us in due time the fullness of all we desire. By neglecting the necessary concrete labor, by sparing ourselves the little daily tax, we are positively digging the graves of our higher possibilities.

She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields. … There she sat in that tent with her children huddled around her, and seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me.

When I was a boy in Scotland I was fond of everything that was wild, and all my life I've been growing fonder and fonder of wild places and wild creatures. Fortunately around my native town, by the stormy North Sea, there was no lack of wildness, though most of the land lay in smooth cultivation. I loved to wander in the fields to hear the birds sing, and along the seashore to gaze and wonder at the shells and seaweeds, eels and crabs in the pools among the rocks when the tide was low. After I was five or six years old I ran away to the seashore or the fields almost every Saturday, and every day in the school vacations, though solemnly warned that I must play at home in the garden and back yard. All in vain. In spite of the sure punishments that followed like shadows, the natural wildness in my blood ran true on its glorious course as invincible and unstoppable as stars.

What suggestions of imperturbability and being, as against the human trait of mere seeming. It is, yet says nothing. How it rebukes by its tough and equable serenity all weathers. Science scoffs at reminiscence of trees speaking. But, if they don't, they do as well as most speaking, writing, poetry -- or rather they do a great deal better.

Balmy spring -- weeks later than we expected, and months later than we longed for her -- comes at last to revive the moss on the roof and walls of our old mansion. She peeps brightly into my study window, inviting me to throw it open. As the casement ascends, forth fly the innumerable forms of thought or fancy that have kept me company in the wintry weather -- visions grotesque and sad, pictures of real life tinted with nature's homely gray and russet. All these may vanish now, and leave me to mold a fresh existence out of sunshine. Brooding Meditation may flap her dusky wings and take her owl-like flight. Such companions befit the season of frosted window-panes and crackling fires. In the spring all somber thoughts should follow the winter northward with the somber and thoughtful crows. The old paradisiacal economy of life is again in force: We live, not to think nor to labor, but for the simple end of being happy.

The assertion was very just; for if true greatness consists in possessing a mighty genius, and in having employed it to enlighten our own mind and that of others, then one like Sir Isaac Newton, whose equal is hardly found in a thousand years, is the truly great personage. Those claim our respect who command over the minds of the rest of the world by the force of truth, not those who enslave their fellow-creatures: they who are acquainted with the universe, not they who deface it.

Another shadow, not so long, and a little broader, stretched itself beside his, for Mother was also in the field, helping her husband to load the golden sheaves upon an old blue farm-cart, which stood nearby. There were also two short, fat shadows which bobbed briskly about over the green meadow as their owners danced among the wheat.

White, yellow, and red bulbs range in size from bite-sized to large and can be round, flat, top-, or spindle-shaped. Onions are cool-season vegetables -- they grow best in temperatures cooler than warm-season vegetables -- and can be grown successfully throughout most of temperate North America. There are three ways to grow onions: from sets, transplants, or seeds. Several varieties of onions are used for onion sets, and these varieties can be widely adaptable. Growing onions from transplants often produces large, attractive onions. These young onion seedlings can be purchased in bundles, and gardeners should try to match varieties to their location. Location will also determine when you plant onion seeds, if you choose that route. However you choose to grow onions, after you harvest them, the ways they can be eaten are limitless.

Phobias can be triggered by the sound of wind, thunder, or rain; flashes of lightning; a drop in air pressure; the electrical charge of the air, or any combination of these factors. What can you do if your dog is scared of storms? There's no easy fix. The first step is to talk to your veterinarian. Your vet may be able to help you modify your dog's behavior by exposing your dog to gentle reminders of thunderstorms, such as thunderstorm recordings played softly while your dog receives treats and other positive reinforcement. If this gentle retraining doesn't work, your veterinarian may prescribe anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications to help your dog remain calm during storms. Above all, the most important thing to do is treat your dog gently and kindly when it's afraid.

Based on the passage, one way to help a dog with a storm phobia is to

A.	play gentle music while giving it treats.

If you don't mind marinating and then slowly cooking it in liquid, choose a steak with the word ""chuck"" or ""round"" in its name. Usually these cuts of meat are lean and require more cooking time to be tender. A steak with the word ""loin"" or ""rib"" on the label naturally tends to be a tender cut and can be cooked quickly using a grill, stove, or oven. You'll also choose a grade of meat. Prime is the top grade, but most prime steaks are used in restaurants and hotels. In the supermarket, your grade options are choice and select. Choice is the higher grade and the leanest, while the least expensive meat is generally of select grade. By knowing more about what kind of steak you're looking for, you can increase your chances of getting a steak you'll enjoy.

The first group known to inhabit the area was the Pinto Culture, followed by the Serrano, the Chemehuevi, and the Cahuilla. In the 1800s, cattlemen drove their herds into the area for the ample grass available. Miners dug tunnels through the earth looking for gold and made tracks across the desert with their trucks. Homesteaders began filing claims in the 1900s. They built cabins, dug wells, and planted crops. Each group left its mark upon the land and contributed to the rich cultural history of the park. The park protects 501 archeological sites, 88 historic structures, 19 cultural landscapes, and houses 123,253 items in its museum. After the area became a national monument in 1936, local and regional residents were the primary park visitors.

In 1884, Paul Nipkow patented an electromechanical television system for transmitting images using rotating metal discs. In 1897, Karl Braun invented the cathode ray tube, which produces an image when an electron beam strikes a phosphorescent surface. The cathode ray tube enabled several inventors, including A.A. Campbell-Swinton and Boris Rosing, to develop television systems. In 1925, John Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion. In 1926, Baird demonstrated a televised image with 30 lines of resolution, enough to distinguish a human face. In 1927, Philo Farnsworth filed for a patent on a complete electronic television system. Television owes its creation to many pioneers, rather than to just one inventor.

A humorist is often without honor in his own country. Perhaps this is partly because humor is likely to be familiar, and familiarity breeds contempt. Perhaps it is partly because (for some strange reason) we tend to despise those who make us laugh, while we respect those who make us weep -- forgetting that there are formulas for forcing tears quite as facile as the formulas for forcing smiles. Whatever the reason, the fact is indisputable that the humorist must pay the penalty of his humor, he must run the risk of being tolerated as a mere fun-maker, not to be taken seriously, and not worthy of critical consideration. This penalty has been paid by Mark Twain. In many of the discussions of American literature he has been dismissed as though he were only a competitor of his predecessors instead of being a writer who is to be classed -- at whatever interval only time may decide -- rather with Cervantes and Moliere.

When picking your location, find a close group of trees, so your structure will have more support. And don't build it too high -- ten feet should be about right. Don't commit to an overly complicated design that you cannot build. Start with a basic, open design: a platform, sides and bracings. Make sure you have an adequate supply of sturdy lumber and power tools. (A good saw is absolutely crucial to cut the lumber properly.) Plan on taking a full day to complete the project -- you'll spend at least six hours constructing a simple platform. Finally, be certain children are not playing in your workspace. A potentially dangerous construction site is no place for children's play. There will be time for that when the treehouse is built.

Which of the author's phrases is most likely an exaggeration?

A.	no place for play
B.	absolutely crucial
C.	the greatest of joys
D.	overly complicated

When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.

The author describes the setting largely in terms of its

A.	size.
B.	color.
C.	flatness.

I'd never seen anything like it: A perfect pearl of a berry, with a dark spot at its tip. I have since learned the berry inspired the plant's common name: doll's eyes. Another name for this American native plant is baneberry, a reference to the berries' toxicity. Early records show they may have had some medicinal value. Now my shade garden includes a patch of doll's eyes that light up each May with delicate white flowers that emit a citrus-like fragrance at close encounter. The plant's primary pollinators include European snout beetles, solitary bees, and syrphids (flies). By summer, flower stalks turn blood-red and issue striking clusters of berries. Birds and rodents devour the fruit by summer's end, and the plant disappears until spring.

According to the passage, the plant's name comes from its

A.	odor.

As a child, he spent many evenings with his older brother, a lighting engineer for the local opera company. Together, they would sit on the rafters, above the singers, an unseen but essential part of the spectacle. As an adult, my grandfather preferred the cheap seats, all the way up by the ceiling, for it reminded him of those magical nights. Some newcomers to opera are put off by what may seem like overwrought drama and exaggerated dialogue, but my grandfather made it all make sense: Opera is not about words or the veracity of action; it is about emotion put to music and voice. I too prefer the cheap seats -- my grandfather's joy of sharing the experience with me still fresh in my mind.

According to the passage, the author's love of opera originates from the

A.	comforting use of music and voice.

In that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly called Somersetshire, there lately lived, and perhaps lives still, a gentleman whose name was Allworthy, and who might well be called the favorite of both nature and fortune; for both of these seem to have contended which should bless and enrich him most. In this contention, nature may seem to some to have come off victorious, as she bestowed on him many gifts, while fortune had only one gift in her power; but in pouring forth this, she was so very profuse, that others perhaps may think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to all the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature. From the former of these, he derived an agreeable person, a sound constitution, a solid understanding, and a benevolent heart; by the latter, he was decreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the county.

There were three distinct stages in Annette Brougham's attitude towards the knocking in the room above. In the beginning it had been merely a vague discomfort. Absorbed in the composition of her waltz, she had heard it almost subconsciously. The second stage set in when it became a physical pain like red-hot pincers wrenching her mind from her music. Finally, with a thrill in indignation, she knew it for what it was -- an insult. The unseen brute disliked her playing. Defiantly, with her foot on the loud pedal, she struck the keys once more. 'Bang!' from the room above. 'Bang! Bang!' Annette rose. Her face was pink. Her eyes sparkled with the light of battle. She left the room and started to mount the stairs. No spectator could have helped feeling a pang of pity for the wretched man who stood unconscious of imminent doom behind the door at which she was on the point of tapping.

Little minds need to practice despotism to relieve their nerves, just as great souls thirst for equality in friendship to exercise their hearts. Narrow natures expand by persecuting as much as others through beneficence; they prove their power over their fellows by tyranny as others do by kindness; they simply go the way their temperaments drive them.

This is Fingal's Cave, on Scotland's island of Staffa, an uninhabited remnant of a volcanic eruption 60 million years ago. Waves, trapped by the cave's walls, wail and moan. Celts called this Uamh-Binn, ""the melodious cave."" My favorite description of this place is musical: ""greener roar of waves surely never rushed into a stranger cavern -- its many pillars made it look like the inside of an immense organ, black and resounding, and absolutely without purpose, and quite alone, the wide grey sea within and without."" The quote is attributed to Karl Klingemann, a travel companion to the great romantic composer Felix Mendelssohn.

The 2012 transit won't be repeated until the year 2117. Transits of Venus first gained worldwide attention in the 18th century when the size of the solar system was one of science's biggest mysteries. The relative spacing of planets was known, but not their absolute distances. Venus was the key, according to astronomer Edmund Halley who realized that by observing transits from widely-spaced locations on Earth, it was possible to triangulate the distance to Venus using the principles of parallax. The idea galvanized scientists to go on expeditions around the world to view a pair of transits in the 1760s. Some historians have called the international effort ""the Apollo program of the 18th century.""

The main point of the passage about the transit of Venus is that it

A.	inspired scientific-minded people to study the planets.

Home from work, I'd grab my camera, sit on the patio and wait for wildlife to come to me. But nothing approached. As spring turned to summer, I noticed new birds and insects -- flowers and berries drew them closer. This gave me an idea: I'd grab peanuts or bird seed, scatter them on the patio and wait. The blue jays approached first. Then the squirrels came. The squirrels became so familiar with my routine that I started recognizing them as individuals both by special markings or scars and behavior. Other visitors -- even frogs and snakes -- appeared. Soon, I began to recognize the different species of birds and their calls and songs. My discovery of photography brought the nature in my backyard into much better focus.

But these are a mere chorus to the caves' chief attraction: Arachnocampa luminosa, the glowworm. A boat takes you to see their grandest display, a fitting tribute to the caves' history: In the 1880s, a Maori chief, Tane Tinorau, and a British surveyor, Fred Mace, first explored these chambers on a raft with nothing but candlelight to guide them. But today, no candlelight for you -- quietly, you float through the damp, cool corridors. Then, a smattering of dim green light pierces the blackness, below which, illuminated silky threads are suspended from glowworm nests. Is this it? It'd be impressive enough, but, another turn, and you forget to breathe: You are in a cathedral of bioluminescence, the Glowworm Grotto, as mesmerized as the glowworms' prey -- the sticky garlands are snares for river insects, lost in the dark.

It was fifty-five minutes past eleven on a morning in 1831. At a small brass telescope stood a man with far-seeing hazel eyes. He turned for a moment and nodded reassuringly at his curly-headed little daughter seated on the stool beside him. The dark eyes of one reflected the deep intensity of the other as they turned again to their allotted tasks with a profound absorption that nothing on earth could disturb. The moon approached nearer the sun's limb. The unnatural silence was broken only by the low voice of the little girl, counting. She bent over the chronometer and the steady count went on. At last her father gave the signal. The beginning of an annular eclipse had occurred on Nantucket on the 19th of February, 1831, at eleven hours, fifty-five minutes and seven seconds. The little girl looked up in awe at the darkened sun. Without looking down she slowly closed her observing notebook.

The concept ""true"" does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry, because by the word ""true"" we are eventually in the habit of designating always the correspondence with a ""real"" object; geometry, however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these ideas among themselves.

In this method the organic materials are heated with water and 10 to 15 percent of caustic potassa. As soon as disintegration is completed, nitrate of lime is added, and the mixture evaporated to dryness. A glowing coal is then placed upon the carbonaceous residue obtained: the mass, undergoing combustion, leaves a perfectly white residue. This residue dissolves in hydrochloric acid to a clear fluid which is then examined for poisons. The above process possesses the undeniable advantage of completely destroying the organic substances, at the same time avoiding the introduction of sulphate of potassa, the presence of which impairs the usefulness of the preceding method; but it necessitates the presence of numerous foreign bodies in the substance to be analysed, and this should be avoided.

One of the most delightful phases of bulb-growing is that of the cultivation of hardy species in the grass. Nowhere do they look so well as against the grass, whose leafage seems to harmonize so well with the general character of the bulbous plants. In addition to this, many of these bulbous plants will thrive much better in grass than in a cultivated border, where there is often too much bare soil. It is advisable that the bulbs should not be planted where a neatly kept grass plot is wanted early in the year. In planting the bulbs, they ought not to be arranged in regular lines, but in masses or informal groups. As good a plan as any to follow in planting in masses in the wilder parts of the grounds, is to throw the bulbs down from the hand, and to plant them where they fall -- to form charming groups and masses of greater beauty than any formal arrangement would give.

Chocolate actually comes from the cacao bean that grows in cacao pods on the tree Theobroma cacao. Getting the bean isn't easy. Only three of every one thousand flowers are pollinated to produce a pod. Harvesting is done by hand to prevent damaging the sensitive trees and their flowers. Once harvested, the pods are fermented to separate the cacao beans from their pods. Cacao beans are ground into a paste that can then be refined and mixed into chocolate or cocoa powder to be used for many different foods. But chocolate wasn't always used this way. Historically, ancient Aztec tribes in Central America used cacao beans as a form of currency, traded them for produce, and produced a beverage with them. Later, Europeans were introduced to chocolate by drinking it. It wasn't until the 19th century that the first sweetened ""eating chocolate"" was presented in England. Years later, a Swiss chocolatier added milk -- it was after this that chocolate became the delicious treat we know today.

As the development of land and water resources increases, it is apparent that development of either of these resources affects the quantity and quality of the other. Nearly all surface-water features (streams, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and estuaries) interact with ground water. These interactions take many forms. In many situations, surface-water bodies gain water and solutes from ground-water systems and in others the surface-water body is a source of ground-water recharge and causes changes in ground-water quality. As a result, withdrawal of water from streams can deplete ground water or conversely, pumpage of ground water can deplete water in streams, lakes, or wetlands. Pollution of surface water can cause degradation of ground-water quality and conversely pollution of ground water can degrade surface water. Thus, effective land and water management requires a clear understanding of the linkages between ground water and surface water as it applies to any given hydrologic setting.

A.	interact with ground water to create a new source of pollution.

An agrarian society, the Hohokams required efficient systems for transporting water to sustain their crops in the desert. At the tribe's peak, over 500 miles of canals were formed from hand-dug trenches that were up to 12 feet deep and fed with water from the Salt River. Wide at their mouths and tapered at their ends, the canals efficiently stabilized the flow of water. This is important because rapidly flowing water has the potential to cause sand and silt buildup, impeding effective irrigation of crops. Along with their advanced canal systems, the Hohokams are known for their architectural structures, pottery, and turquoise jewelry.

Based on the passage, the Hohokam tribe's canals were engineered in a way that

A.	is still popular in Arizona today.
B.	controlled the irrigation flow rate.
C.	carried fertile silt to the crop fields.
D.	allowed for a continuous rapid flow rate.

The two men first met when they both spoke at a meeting of the Baltimore Civil Service Reform Association in 1892. Roosevelt, then Civil Service commissioner, boasted of his reforms in federal law enforcement. In those days, law enforcement was often political rather than professional. Roosevelt and Bonaparte both shared the conviction that efficiency and expertise, not political connections, should determine who could best serve in government. Roosevelt became president of the United States in 1901; four years later, he appointed Bonaparte to be attorney general. In 1908, Bonaparte created a corps of special agents. It had neither a name nor an officially designated leader other than the attorney general. Yet, these former detectives and Secret Service men were the forerunners of the FBI.

In discussing the FBI, the author's primary focus is on its

The Prince, written in 1513 by Italian political thinker Niccolo Machiavelli, is the inspiration behind several political, philosophical, and ethical (or unethical, depending on the reader's view) maxims or perspectives, including the well-known ""The end justifies the means."" In The Prince, Machiavelli suggests that rulers' personal morality may be changeable for the public good -- when public necessity demands an action that personal principles condemn as unethical, not only is the act justifiable, but the ruler needn't even feel any guilt about carrying it out. Concrete definitions of right and wrong do not exist for the prince in Machiavelli's book; instead, all moral considerations and consequences are situational, and the situation is always based on what is congruous with successful rule. 

Based on the passage, rulers don't have to regret doing an unethical deed if they have

Much like the protagonist Jo March in Little Women, Alcott had an early passion for writing and was a tomboy. Similar to the March family's trials and tribulations in the novel, Alcott's family was impoverished, and her family experienced constant financial struggles. Alcott began writing poetry and short stories for magazines in order to augment her family's income, just as Jo March does in the story that is set in Alcott's hometown during the Civil War. Little Women became Alcott's best-known work and is notable for its depiction of an individualistic female protagonist -- an uncommon characteristic for its publication period of the late 1860s.

The main point of the passage is that Little Women was

A.	largely autobiographical.

At the end of the eighteenth, in the year of grace 1792, it had not yet gained the notoriety and importance which a hundred additional years and the craze of the age have since bestowed upon it. Yet it was an old place, even then, for the oak rafters and beams were already black with age -- as were the paneled seats, with their tall backs, and the long polished tables between, on which innumerable pewter tankards had left fantastic patterns of many-sized rings. In the leaded window, high up, a row of pots of scarlet geraniums and blue larkspur gave the bright note of color against the dull background of the oak.

Shoveling is strenuous exercise, so stretch your back, legs, and shoulders. When you're ready to head outside, decide where you're going to put the snow so you don't have to move it twice. When you begin shoveling, start out slowly. Again, think of it as exercise. As you shovel, push the snow rather than lift it and remember to use proper posture. Use your legs and shoulders rather than your back. Finally, take many breaks, stay hydrated and stretch again when you're finished. Shoveling snow is hard work, and it's important to take care of yourself while you're doing it.

According to the passage, what should you do as you begin shoveling?

One option is the progressive relaxation technique, which requires you to focus on tightening and then relaxing each muscle group. You can practice it alone or in combination with another technique, such as guided image or deep breathing. The guided image method replaces stressful feelings with pleasant images. The deep breathing technique focuses on slowing breathing and taking deep, regular breaths. Autogenic training and self-hypnosis are additional methods. With autogenic training you focus on physical sensations and visualize your body in a certain way -- for example, warm or relaxed. To utilize the self-hypnosis technique, choose a phrase or nonverbal cue and use it to create a relaxation response. There are many different relaxation techniques, and one of them may work for you.

After you've spent time thinking about your mistake, it's time to determine what you're going to say. Two important elements of an apology are acknowledging what you did and expressing your regret for it. These details show the injured party that you are empathetic -- that you recognize the grievance they felt. You should also be clear that you take responsibility for what you did. Don't try to blame other people or make excuses. Also, explain how you're going to remedy the situation if a remedy is possible. This could mean you need to promise it will never happen again or come up with a specific plan; the other person needs to hear that you've thought about what happened and how to avoid it in the future. Finally, forgive yourself. Everyone makes mistakes.

According to the passage, what indicates empathy for the injured party?

A.	stating what you did wrong and saying you're sorry you did it
B.	thinking about what you've done and discovering why you did it

For example, a person may feel indifferent boredom when on a long car ride through a dull area. Apathetic boredom can feel similar to hopelessness. One study showed a high percentage of high school students felt apathetic boredom. Uncertainty and openness to changing a situation characterize calibrating boredom; people experiencing calibrating boredom are more open to, and will actively seek, any non-specific change to their current situation. By contrast, those feeling reactant boredom are highly motivated to get out of the boring situation by looking toward a specific alternative. Finally, an individual with searching boredom is restless and open to any other opportunity that presents itself.

I was such a perfectionist that worrying I wouldn't produce a perfect final product kept me from following my dreams of writing a novel. I still haven't written that novel, but I finally started. Here's what I did to change my habit of putting it off. First, I committed to writing the novel by creating a contract with myself. Next, I broke my giant project into smaller pieces. Writing a novel is intimidating, but writing a page a day for a week is manageable. On a day-to-day basis, I focus on the present and acknowledge that even the small steps I take move me closer to my goal. By following this method I got out of my rut. Now, I'm much closer to my finished novel than I was a few months ago. Hopefully, my old procrastinating self is gone for good!

If you're a beginning hiker, it's best to select a trail that's easier than what you think you can handle. You should also keep your pack light, although there are things you need to bring with you on every hike. These items include a map and compass, or GPS; water and food; rain gear; safety equipment like a first aid kit; a multipurpose tool; and sunscreen and sunglasses. By keeping your pack light and walking at a slow pace you can help avoid overexerting yourself. If you're out of breath while hiking, then you're going too fast. Taking frequent breaks and eating and drinking while you hike are also important tips. Making these good choices before and while hiking can help you have a fun and safe outing.

What Is Telephotography? We may say that telephotography is an answer to the problem of how to photograph distant objects and still obtain a satisfactory image size. We find that a ""long-focus"" or telephoto lens includes less subject matter from any given distance, hence objects are proportionally larger than they would have been if photographed from the same distance with a lens of shorter focal length. Only recently has the widespread use of telephoto objectives become so popular. We suspect that this is due largely to the greater availability of good lenses in the telephoto class at comparatively inexpensive cost, rather than a greater awareness of the potentials of these long optics among photographers. All in all, telephotography can be a useful asset to the technique of any photographer and a long lens should be a member of every worker's optical arsenal.

Based on the passage, telephotography became more popular due to

A.	a shift in awareness by photographers.
B.	a new type of lens being fashionable.

But, on the other hand, I'm not the least bit afraid of you. And as I've said before, and shall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can look after herself, thank you!"" And with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a result of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct route and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments, a telegraph form in her hand. The thought of a possible five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the waste of ninepence.

The practical value of astronomy in the past is easily established. Without it, international commerce on a large scale would have been impossible. Without the aid of astronomy, accurate boundaries of large tracts of land could not have been defined and standard time would have been impossible. The work of the early astronomers was eminently practical, and appealed at once to everyone. This work has now been finished. We can compute the positions of the stars for years…with all the accuracy needed for navigation, for determining time or for approximate boundaries of countries. The investigations now in progress at the greatest observatories have little, if any, value in dollars and cents. They appeal, however, to the far higher sense, the desire of the intellectual human being to determine the laws of nature, the construction of the material universe, and the properties of the heavenly bodies of which those known to exist far outnumber those that can be seen.

By 1803, the mission had become a barracks for Spanish soldiers, and around this time it was renamed Alamo, which is the Spanish word for the trees that are called ""cottonwoods"" in English. In 1836, a battle between Mexican troops and Texan revolutionaries during the Texas Revolution made the Alamo famous.

Data are collected using a calling survey technique, in which volunteers identify local amphibian species by their unique breeding vocalizations or calls. If you'd like to volunteer, it means you must be willing to learn the survey protocols and how to identify frogs and toads by their calls. Once you learn this, you must then take the on-line ""Frog Quiz"" to document your frog call identification ability. Each volunteer selects an available roadside route with 10 listening stops. Volunteers survey the route several times per year, generally in the spring through summer. Surveys are conducted in the evening, starting 30 minutes after sunset or later. Each survey takes approximately 90 minutes to complete. If interested, you're asked to participate in the program for at least 3 years.

The grounds on which idealism is advocated are generally grounds derived from the theory of knowledge, that is to say, from a discussion of the conditions, which things must satisfy in order that we may be able to know them. The first serious attempt to establish idealism on such grounds was that of Bishop Berkeley. He proved first, by arguments which were largely valid, that our sense-data cannot be supposed to have an existence independent of us, but must be, in part at least, 'in' the mind, in the sense that their existence would not continue if there were no seeing or hearing or touching or smelling or tasting.

A particularly grueling race consisted of running in the protective clothing of a soldier, which included a shield, helmet, and bronze leg-guards; together these weighed about 60 pounds. During the long jump, athletes held stone or lead weights in front of them and then swung the weights backward to provide forward thrust. In an event that was a cross between wrestling and boxing, biting was prohibited, but finger-bending and hair-pulling were allowed. While the modern Olympics draw inspiration from the original Games, there are certainly significant differences in the events.

Based on the passage, in the ancient Olympic Games, long jump athletes

A.	had to wear military armor.
B.	tried to trip their opponents.

He dreamed of finding a way for his mother, who was a large woman, to be able to watch movies from the comfort of her own vehicle. To achieve this objective, he experimented with the idea for several years and never lost his determination. In these experiments Hollingshead used a 1928 Kodak projector and mounted it on the hood of his car, projecting the image onto a makeshift screen nailed to trees in his backyard. After many trials, Hollingshead finally applied for and received a patent in 1933 and opened his first drive-in theater. His achievement started a new sensation, and similar theaters were soon established across the United States.

In describing Hollingshead, the author's primary focus is on his

Utilizing the carbon dioxide produced by animals as they respire, flowering plants produce not just attractive and fragrant blossoms -- they produce breathable oxygen, too. Pollination is what makes it possible for these flowering plants to reproduce and is thus essential to their survival. Furthermore, pollination ultimately enables flowering plants to prevent erosion of the earth's soil. The roots of these plants help hold the soil in place, and their foliage lessens the impact of the rain on the soil. Pollination also aids the human population, as it helps produce the flowering plants that provide nourishment for people to thrive.

The main point of the passage is that pollination

A.	aids in the reproduction of flowering plants.
B.	can have a profound effect on food production.
C.	decreases damage to earth's soil caused by harmful erosion.
D.	allows flowering plants to benefit humans and the environment.

But determining the actual inventor of the machine is a complicated task. Archaeologists claim that early versions of cotton gins, dating to the first century, consisted of a single roller made of iron or wood and a flat piece of stone. Remains of this type of gin have been excavated at sites around the world. Others claim that Catherine Littlefield Greene, Whitney's employer, suggested that he use a brush-like instrument to separate seeds from cotton. Regardless of who had the first idea for the machine, the patenting and mass production of the cotton gin undoubtedly was important in forever changing cotton farming in the southern United States.

The author's main point in the passage is that

This belief often results in adherents pursuing the paranormal for recreation. The dynamic travel industry is poised to offer these believers a niche holiday in the emerging paranormal tourism market. Paranormal tourism does not simply consist of explorations of haunted abodes, but can encompass visits to graveyards, or dilapidated old castles or hotels. Because it contains a wealth of such sites, England has emerged as a prime destination for paranormal tourists. Professional ghost hunters have been roaming the eerie English countryside for years, and now tourists have the chance to accompany them. Whether or not an actual haunting is experienced, a paranormal tourist can have an authentic experience in England.

By far the most deadly event in recent history, though, was the influenza pandemic of 1918. Up to one fifth of the world's population at the time -- an estimated 30 to 100 million people -- died from this deadly virus. Scientists today are still not sure of the cause of such lethality, but several factors combined to contribute to the high mortality rate. The virus was geographically indiscriminate, affected young adults who usually exhibit more robust immunity to infectious diseases, and sometimes killed within hours of initial symptoms. Though questions regarding the 1918 pandemic may remain forever unanswered, scientists acknowledge that since it happened once, an equally devastating pandemic could occur under similar conditions.

Service animals have undisputedly improved the lives of many disabled adults, and they could have a similar transformative effect on the daily activities of many disabled children and adolescents as well. However, before allowing animals into a classroom, there are several factors that must be considered. First, either students or teachers could have an allergy to dogs that would prohibit close contact with the service animal. Second, having an uncaged animal in a classroom could prove to be a distraction that would inhibit learning by disrupting students' focus. Finally, no matter how well-trained the animal is, it is still an animal and thus has the potential to become aggressive or bite. Although a service animal could be helpful for an individual disabled student, the risks posed to the entire classroom must be carefully considered before allowing the animal in school.

Based on the passage, the author's main point is that service animals

A.	should only be used by disabled adults.

The recommendation to use sunscreen to protect against cancer is everywhere, but whether it should be the only advice is debatable. While the effectiveness of sunscreen is currently measured by its ability to protect against UVB rays, scientists know that UVA rays also play a contributing role in the development of cancer. Consumers must carefully read sunscreen labels and purchase a sunscreen that protects against damage caused by both types of rays. Additionally, even water-resistant sunscreens must be reapplied after exposure to water or sweat. It is therefore wise to use supplemental methods of protection. Other recommended measures include wearing a hat and sun-protective clothing, seeking shade when possible, and wearing UV protective sunglasses. An aggressive, multifaceted protection plan against harmful ultraviolet sunlight will help to decrease the occurrences of skin cancers.

Many animals, such as primates and birds, vocalize to convey warnings, the location of food, or availability for mating. Within a given species, the sounds animals make are similar. Whales, scientists have long known, communicate using a series of clicks and whistles, thought to serve similar functions that vocalizations do in other species. Whales from varying geographic areas, however, appear to use different dialects! Researchers have discovered that the sounds made by blue whale groups in the Pacific Northwest differ from those in Antarctica and from those in Chile. Additionally, sperm whales may be able to distinguish individuals within a group by the sounds of their clicks, somewhat like humans are able to identify the sound of a friend's voice.

Over time, a variety of diets have captured the attention of Americans. Low-fat diets were once popular, but an increasing trend is toward greater protein consumption. Some ""new"" diets are reinventions from earlier times--the low-carbohydrate diet attributed to Dr. Robert Atkins in the 1970s was first suggested in 1863 by William Banting. Fads, including the cabbage soup diet and the cigarette diet, may accomplish weight loss in the short term but are not considered healthy or sustainable.

American architect Frank Lloyd Wright created some of the 20th century's most innovative buildings, including Fallingwater, a private residence in southwest Pennsylvania that he designed in 1935. The dwelling, suspended over a 30-foot waterfall, appears to grow naturally out of the rocks. A series of balconies soar horizontally out over the cascading water, while the vertical stone walls are anchored to the bedrock. Although the square footage is relatively limited, the expanse of windows opens up the space to views of the surrounding woods. The central focus of the interior is the sandstone fireplace, with a large boulder protruding through the floor in front of the hearth. Only two colors of paint were used throughout, both drawn from the environment: dark red for the steel and yellow-orange for the reinforced concrete.

I, and other psychologists, call this the X-factor and believe it is composed of a combination of characteristics. One characteristic, charisma, is a magnetic charm that draws others in and can lead to devotion; often sought in leaders, it's a trait that can't be taught. Then there is the audacity to challenge convention, an extreme self-confidence that enables people to take risks for themselves and others. Although this audacity is innate, certain experiences draw it out. Third is exuberance, which makes people fun to be around. Those who possess this trait appear to have been born with it. Finally, grace, the ability to remain composed even in difficult situations, is the most teachable trait.

Beginning in the winter of 2006, however, millions of honeybees began disappearing. Known as colony collapse disorder (CCD), this phenomenon results in adult bees abandoning the hive, leaving behind the queen and younger bees to fend for themselves. Populations of bumblebees, pollinators of crops such as blueberries and tomatoes, are undergoing a similar decline. Agricultural researchers have studied factors that contribute to CCD, including contact with pesticides and tiny parasitic mites, which damage bees and also carry viruses that target bees' immune systems. It is expected that combatting CCD will entail a combination of approaches, including changes in hive management, improvements to bee breeding programs, and possibly genetically targeted treatment of viruses.

The story is that Elizabeth, also known as Betsy, recommended that, contrary to Mr. Washington's request, the stars for this new flag should have five points rather than six. Five-pointed stars, she explained, were easier to make because after folding the cloth a certain way, they could be cut out with a single snip of the scissors.

But there are ways to preserve and store milk for very long periods of time -- years, even -- and it's done by making the milk into cheese. Adding certain types of healthy bacteria to milk and then warming the milk for a time at specific temperatures causes the milk to curdle and form into a thickened mass called a curd; the leftover liquid is called whey. After the whey is drained out, the fresh curd is cut into little cubes and placed into a cheese press to remove more of the whey. Under pressure, the cheese curds begin to form together again into a single mass -- cheese. Some cheeses are eaten immediately after they have been pressed or molded. Some are aged for many months or even years.

Based on the passage, once bacteria have been added, creating curds requires

A.	souring milk.
B.	heating the milk.

They would then add the columns or rows of numbers, or average them, or perform any of several mathematical operations. They'd do it with paper, pencil, and basic math skills. But if only one number changed, it could alter the outcome of the entire sheet, and all the calculations would have to be done again, by hand. Today's computerized spreadsheets can instantaneously update every relevant row and column of numbers whenever a change is made anywhere on the page. What used to take hours to complete can now be done in seconds.

The polar bear's long, coarse ""guard"" hairs, which protect the plush thick undercoat, are hollow and transparent. The thinner hairs of the undercoat are not hollow, but they, like the guard hairs, are colorless. The hair of a polar bear looks white because the air spaces inside each hair scatter light of all colors. The color white becomes visible to our eyes when an object reflects back all of the visible wavelengths of light, rather than absorbing some of the wavelengths. In the late 1970's, scientists discovered another interesting tidbit about a polar bear's fur. A number of polar bears in zoos from around the world were turning green! These scientists discovered that the algae responsible for making the bears green were not on the surface of the hairs, as originally suspected, but were inside the hairs. The algae more than likely came from the pond waters in the bears' enclosures. So the next time someone asks what color is a polar bear, perhaps the best answers is ""it depends.""

According to the passage, a polar bear's fur appears white because

A.	each guard hair of a polar bear only reflects one wavelength of light.
B.	light scatters in the bear's fur and reflects back all visible light.
C.	the bear lives in an environment of ice and snow.

With its intricate network of 60,000 miles of tubes -- our blood vessels -- the cardiovascular system feeds the body with life-giving blood nonstop for as long as we live. The blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart are called arteries; those that return blood back to the heart are called veins. The two main arteries leading out from the heart are called the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The blood pumped by the heart into the aorta is oxygen-rich -- just what our cells require. But the blood our heart pumps into our pulmonary artery is oxygen-poor. That blood heads straight for our lungs for a fresh refill of oxygen before it is ready to be sent to other parts of the body.

For decades, many towns had laws banning farm animals, including chickens, from being kept within town limits. But as a growing number of consumers seek ways to reduce the energy and carbon emissions it takes to transport food, more municipalities are allowing people to raise a limited number of chickens within city limits. Chickens are desirable because they can provide fresh eggs. The shipping cost of a morning omelet becomes no more than the time it takes to walk across the yard to fetch the egg. Although some public health officials have warned that home-grown chickens pose a risk of spreading avian flu, advocates of backyard chickens argue that such birds are more healthy than factory-farmed poultry.

Considered the most intelligent of the invertebrates, it has the ability to almost instantly camouflage itself to match the color, design, or physical features of its surroundings. In this way, it hides from attackers in plain sight. If discovered, however, the octopus releases a jet of black ink that not only clouds a predator's view but also dulls its ability to smell, giving the octopus an even greater chance of escape. The octopus also has a remarkable ability to squeeze into places so small that only a few predators can reach. When the octopus does move, it is a fast swimmer, and can jet forward by expelling water through its mantle. Not a large animal, the common octopus rarely gets bigger than about four feet long.

Two major reasons why oil doesn't mix with water have to do with viscosity and density. Oil has a higher viscosity than water, which means that its molecular composition gives it more internal friction, so that it tends to retain its shape longer under stresses, or outside forces. In other words, it ""sticks to itself"" more than water does; it has more cohesion than water. As for density, oil is less dense than water, which means that a spoonful of oil has less mass than a spoonful of water. This difference in density is why oil floats on top of water, creating oil slicks.

Based on the passage, oil ""sticks to itself"" more than water because it

A.	has heavier molecules.
B.	is under greater stress.

Their mothers are probably nearby, watching. If a fledgling is on the ground in a high-risk place, such as a busy sidewalk, move it to safety -- into a shrub or tree. Contrary to popular belief, it's okay to touch it; almost all birds in the United States have a poor sense of smell and do not abandon chicks based on scent. If the chick has very few feathers, it is a nestling. If possible, return it to its nest. Otherwise, find a safe place where it may likely be found by its parent. For injured nestlings or fledglings, contact a wildlife rehabilitator. If you try to hand-raise a baby bird yourself, it's chances of survival are low.

In France in the late 1400s, when monks in the Champagne region were busy making wine, sudden cold temperatures froze rivers and lakes, temporarily stopping the fermentation process essential to wine making. Spring brought warmer temperatures and fermentation started again. This stop and start of fermentation created an overabundance of carbon dioxide in the wine, producing its effervescence, or fizz. By the mid-1600s, the Catholic Church requested a monk, Dom Pierre Perignon, to find a way to stop the champagne bottles from exploding due to excess fizz. But when the Royal Court at Versailles began to prefer bubbly wine, Perignon was directed to increase the fizz, and subsequently perfected what became known as the French Method of champagne making. The method is still in use today.

Good ozone is found in the upper atmosphere and helps to shield the Earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. But human-made chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons and methyl chloroform, deplete the ozone shield, leading to an increase in cases of skin cancers. Bad ozone, the kind located at ground level, triggers a variety of health problems such as lung damage and harms vegetation and ecosystems. Bad ozone is created by a chemical reaction between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds that occurs when sunlight is present. Car exhaust, chemical solvents, and industrial facility emissions are all sources of these chemicals that produce bad ozone.

Deep within our ears are sensitive structures called hair cells. These tiny sensory cells convert the energy of sound into electrical impulses that, through a complicated process, enter our brains, enabling us to hear. Hair cells are irreplaceable, and when they become damaged, they cannot grow back. So, how can you prevent the damage? Knowing what causes it can help. Loudness of noise is measured in decibels -- dB -- and noise that is greater than 85 dB can cause permanent hearing loss. The maximum output of some personal music players is 110 dB, a dangerously high level of sound. If you experience pain or ringing in your ears after listening to music, consider it an early warning sign of hearing loss.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

To make the task easier, first remove the mango's skin from top to bottom with a Y-shaped peeler. It will be slippery, so hold it with a paper towel. Next, determine the mango's tallest line. This is the direction the pit usually runs. With this is mind, cut the mango in half lengthwise while carefully avoiding the pit. Continue steering clear of the pit and cut the opposite side off the mango pit, too. The next step is to cut around the piece of the mango containing the pit. This will help you get as much fruit as possible. Finally, throw out the pit, slice the fruit into small wedges, and enjoy.

Because Earth's crust is constantly changing, rocks from Earth's earliest times most likely no longer exist, so no one can study them. Despite this, there remains plenty of evidence to support the 4.54 billion age estimate. Scientists have been able to determine the probable age of the Solar System and to calculate an age for the Earth by assuming that the Earth and the rest of the solid bodies in the Solar System formed at the same time and are, therefore, of the same age. So, for example, reliable radiometric dating methods used on numerous meteorites and on moon rocks returned from the Apollo missions estimate the same age. Rocks found in Greenland are estimated to be between 3.7–3.8 billion years old. Zircon crystals in rocks in western Australia are 4.0–4.2 billion years old. The best evidence supporting Earth's 4.45-billion-year age is found in the lead of the Canyon Diablo Iron meteorite, which comprises fragments of the asteroid that created Barringer Crater in Arizona.

One early example of this manipulation was by Gustave Le Gray, who wanted to take a beautiful seascape photograph. Chemical processes of the mid-19th century, however, did not allow for equal exposure time of the sky (in order to show clouds), and the ocean (to show the waves). So, he took two pictures and simply put their two negatives together to develop a single image. Other manipulation examples occurred in early war photography. A famous photograph by Roger Fenton depicts a road littered with cannonballs after a battle. People have questioned the authenticity of the photograph because Fenton had two exposures of the exact same road taken after the battle -- one with the cannonballs and one without, meaning that one of the pictures was staged.

The refuge includes approximately 27,000 acres, composed mainly of rich tidal marsh characterized by fluctuating water levels and variable salinity. Other habitat types include freshwater ponds, mixed evergreen and deciduous forests, and small amounts of cropland and managed impoundments that are seasonally flooded for waterfowl use. Blackwater Refuge is one of the chief wintering areas for Canada geese along the Atlantic Flyway, which is a major bird migration ""highway"" along the East Coast. From October through November, as many as 50,000 geese, ducks, and tundra swans stop at Blackwater Refuge. Up to 20 species of ducks and 250 species of other birds may also be seen here, along with several hundred species of plants, 35 species of reptiles and amphibians, and numerous mammals. It is a haven to three recovering species: the endangered Delmarva fox squirrel, the migrant peregrine falcon, and the American bald eagle.

According to the passage, geese use the Atlantic Flyway

A.	as their chief wintering area.

The existence of free verse, as this type of poetry is called, is thanks in large part to a talented French teenager named Arthur Rimbaud. Born in a French village in 1854, Rimbaud wrote his entire collection of work before the age of 20. One of his most famous poems, ""A Season in Hell,"" influenced many subsequent schools of poetry, including French Symbolism and Surrealism, as well as poets of the American Beat Generation of the 1950s. Though he is now considered the father of modernist poetry, Rimbaud stopped writing poetry when he was 19; at that time, he became a colonial tradesman in Africa, where he went on to make a good living trading coffee, feathers, and guns.

According to the passage, which of the following is true about Arthur Rimbaud?

A.	He invented French symbolism.

He rode through walls of fire and jumped over 20 cars. Increasing his risks, Knievel jumped over Greyhound buses, a bed of rattlesnakes, and a tank of live sharks. In 1967, on New Year's Eve, he attempted to jump the fountains in front of a casino in Las Vegas, a distance of 151 feet. The spectacular stunt resulted in a horrific crash that left Knievel in a coma for 29 days. After his recovery, he continued his career as a stuntman, even raising the danger level of his stunts to greater heights. Having escaped death countless times throughout his life, Knievel finally succumbed at the age of 69 to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an incurable form of lung disease.

But there were things in the sky that could not be predicted or that some didn't yet fully understand. Among these were supernova, eclipses, meteor showers, and comets. Supernova, the violent explosions that mark the end of a massive star's life, were completely unpredictable (as they are today) and are quite rare. Eclipses (both solar and lunar) are far more visible, frequently observed, and (thankfully) benign. We now know that meteor showers are the fine grained dust streams left behind from comets and, in a few cases, asteroids as they orbit the sun. While meteor showers and eclipses come and go relatively quickly, comets, when near the sun, with their long ion tails and dust tails to scatter sunlight, can be visible in the night (and day) skies for many days or even weeks. Today, as in the past, these astronomical events are viewed with a sense of awe, wonder, and excitement.

The three eligibility requirements for president of the United States -- specified by Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution -- are that the candidate must be at least 35 years old; must be, at minimum, a 14-year resident of the United States; and must be a natural born citizen. This last requirement has been the source of confusion for many; the phrase ""natural born"" is not clearly defined. The concept of jus soli (""right of the soil"") -- a common-law principle in England -- recognized natural born citizens as only those born within the country. Conversely, jus sanguinis (""right of blood"") -- a rule established later in England by parliamentary statute -- included those born abroad whose parents are citizens. While we cannot know definitively whether the Founding Fathers created the eligibility requirements with common law or parliamentary statutes in mind, the longstanding interpretation has certainly included the rule of jus sanguinis.

On par with the Mona Lisa in terms of its universal recognition and iconic status, The Scream by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, is a work of art that depicts a horrified, hairless, androgynous figure with its eyes and mouth wide open in mid-shriek. The figure stands in the foreground beneath an ominous red sky. In the background are two shadowy figures seemingly unaware of the horror and angst expressed by the person screaming near them. Many critics believe that part of the appeal of The Scream is that it captures the common feeling of being helpless, afraid, overwhelmed, and, ultimately, ignored. An early proponent of Expressionism, Munch helped to spearhead a movement that aspired to express a new form of reality that focused on internal, psychological realms. Munch's use of distorted shapes and vivid colors to portray subjective human emotion became a central technique of Expressionist work.

However, in 1933, a severe storm caused a 785-foot airship, the USS Akron, to plunge into the Atlantic Ocean, claiming the lives of all but three of the 76 men aboard. Considered by many to be the worst airship disaster in history, the craft had no life vests aboard. Two survivors were clinging to a fuel tank and the third was hanging on a wooden board when a German ship rescued them. Four years later, a similar disaster occurred when the Hindenburg, a German airship, burst into flames while landing in New Jersey, killing 36 people. Although both incidents were tragic, the Hindenburg disaster -- due to an unprecedented amount of media coverage at the time -- is more widely known than that of the USS Akron. These disasters marked the end of an era for dreams of widespread lighter-than-air travel.

This special move is called ""castling"" and it involves the king and one of the rooks. In order to castle, each of the squares between the king and the rook must be vacant (three squares for the left rook and two squares for the right). The king moves two squares toward the rook. The rook is then moved to the square through which the king has passed, so that the two pieces are right next to each other. Castling is an important strategy because the king moves away from the center of the board and is thus less vulnerable. The rook, meanwhile, is relocated from its corner square to a more central square, which is a better position for attack.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

Using a small biscuit cutter about two inches in diameter (an empty can or a juice glass can also be used), cut a round hole in the center of the slice of bread. Next, place a frying pan on the stove and set it to medium-low heat. Anything hotter will probably burn your bread before the egg is cooked. Place a tablespoon of butter into the frying pan and wait until it fully melts. Place the bread on the melted butter and crack an egg into the hole.

On June 3, 1950, the French climbers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal reached the summit of Annapurna, making it the first eight-thousand meter (26,545-foot) peak ever successfully climbed. There are 14 ""eight-thousanders"" in all, a number that pushes some climbers to the point of obsession. It's big enough that only the most ambitious consider climbing all of them, but small enough that doing so over a lifetime still seems possible. Annapurna is the only 8,000-meter peak to be conquered on the first try. However, the feat came with a high price.

Although the poetry of Charles Bukowski had its fair share of commercial success, it has largely been ignored by literary critics and scholars, many of whom are not convinced that his work warrants ""serious"" attention and acknowledgment. Some assert that this negligence is not due to the quality of his work, which many rate as superior, but because of the content: he was rough, and coarse, and his poetry often depicted urban vice, decadence, and America's most downtrodden. The rough life Bukowski led was nothing like the more ""academic"" life of many of his poet-contemporaries.

In actuality, a horizontal rod across the flag's top edge held it out; bent in several places, the rod made the flag appear rippled.

This myth seems to pop up every year around the equinox. The idea that an egg can only stand on end on the spring equinox due to the gravitational force of the sun being aligned with the earth sounds like science, but it isn't. The underlying assumption relating to standing eggs on end is that there must exist some special gravitational balance. There are many forces acting on an egg when you try to stand it on end on a flat surface. The most dominant force of gravity on a standing egg is the one between the earth and the egg itself. To assume that some celestial balance occurs only on the spring equinox (but not on the fall equinox!), is to fall prey to bad science.

It was a part-time job, with incumbents retaining their own private practice as they conducted their official duties. The position became a cabinet post in 1792. As years passed, Congress gradually added to the attorney general's responsibilities and tasks. In 1831, Congress raised the salary of the attorney general and included allowances for office expenses. At the end of the Civil War, the amount of litigation involving the United States required the retention of a large number of private attorneys. It became apparent that a more unified -- and more cost-efficient -- alternative was needed. In 1870, Congress passed the Act to Establish the Department of Justice, setting it up as ""an executive department of the government of the United States,"" with the attorney general as its head.

The Nevada Fall is 600 feet high and is usually ranked next to the Yosemite in general interest among the five main falls of the Valley. Coming through the Little Yosemite in tranquil reaches, the river is first broken into rapids on a moraine boulder-bar that crosses the lower end of the Valley. Thence it pursues its way to the head of the fall in a rough, solid rock channel, dashing on side angles, heaving in heavy surging masses against elbow knobs, and swirling and swashing in pot-holes without a moment's rest. Thus, already chafed and dashed to foam, overfolded and twisted, it plunges over the brink of the precipice as if glad to escape into the open air. But before it reaches the bottom it is pulverized yet finer by impinging upon a sloping portion of the cliff about half-way down, thus making it the whitest of all the falls of the Valley, and altogether one of the most wonderful in the world.

Harry Burton woke one night and heard a strange noise in his closet. He got out of bed, crossed the floor in his bare feet, and carefully opened the closet door. The noise stopped, instantly. ""Ah!"" said Harry, ""I knew it was mice made that noise. How I wish I could catch them."" The next morning he told his mother about the noises he had heard. ""I will get you a mouse-trap,"" she said. ""I don't want the kind that kills the mice, I only want to catch them and tame them,"" said Harry. His mother laughed and told him when he had tamed his mice he must keep them well out of her way. The trap was set, the mice were caught, and sure enough, in a short time were so tame they would eat from Harry's hand. He made a little house for them, and kept in it his bedroom. Whenever he went out, he always shut the door carefully.

According to the passage, what happened before Harry and his mother had a conversation?

A.	Mice were tamed.
B.	Traps were purchased.
C.	A little house was made.

The paper is preferably sensitized in operating as follows: Take hold of the paper by the two opposite corners and fold it into a loop, lay it on the iron solution, the center of the sheet first placed in contact with the liquid, and then gradually spread it by lowering the corners with a little pressure. No solution should run over on the back of the paper; it would be a cause of stain. This done, and without allowing the liquid to penetrate in the paper, immediately take hold of the two corners near the body and withdraw the paper by dragging it over on a glass rod for this purpose fixed on the edge of the tray. Now pin up the paper to dry…and sensitize a second time in proceeding in the same manner.

Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook -- Mrs. Grubach was his landlady -- but today she didn't come. That had never happened before. K. waited a little while, looked from his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an inquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the bell. There was immediately a knock at the door and a man entered. He had never seen the man in this house before.

The transversus abdominis muscle group, found deepest in our abdomen, is what stabilizes our trunk and provides internal abdominal pressure. Situated over that muscle group are bulging muscles on the front of the trunk sometimes called the ""six pack""; their actual name is rectus abdominis. These muscles enable bending movements between the ribcage and the pelvis. On each side of them are the external obliques, which permit the trunk to twist -- but to the opposite side of the external oblique that is contracting. The final abdominal muscle group, the internal obliques, are found just inside the hipbones. They help us twist to the same side of the body where they are located. Essential to core body movement, abdominal strength should never be neglected. 

Based on the passage, which muscle group enables bending between the ribcage and pelvis?

A.	internal obliques

The active ingredient in aspirin, salicin, is derived from willow bark, which has been used for more than two thousand years as a treatment for pain. As far back as 400 BC, Hippocrates advised patients to chew on willow bark for pain relief. People in ancient China and throughout Europe were also using willow bark to treat inflammation and fevers. In the 1800s, willow bark was used to develop the pill we recognize today as aspirin. Over the ensuing years different ingredients were added to salicin to make the drug more palatable and chemically stable. In the mid-20th century, further research revealed that aspirin had blood-thinning characteristics. By 1985, aspirin was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in the treatment and secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarctions -- the medical term for heart attacks. Few medications are as useful, beneficial, available, and affordable as aspirin.

But in the 1940s, pinball came to be seen as a game of chance, and thus a form of gambling. Consequently, it was outlawed in many major U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. In that same decade, however, a new development was incorporated into pinball games that changed them forever: the flipper. With a flipper, players could influence the movement of the ball without resorting to tilting or nudging the machine, and pinball became a game depending more on skill than chance. Even so, the game remained illegal in most American cities until the 1970s. That didn't stop the game from being played; it merely went underground. Still popular, pinball has never completely gone out of style.

According to the passage, the addition of the flipper changed the game of pinball by

A.	transforming it into a game of chance.
B.	increasing the level of skill involved.

Mathew Brady and his associates photographed many battlefields, camps, towns, and people touched by the war. Their images depict the multiple aspects of the war, except for one crucial element: battle. Photographs show camp life, routines, war preparations, the moments just prior to battle, and the aftermath of battle. The primitive technology of photography required that subjects be still at the moment the camera's shutter snapped. Battle scenes are, therefore, missing from the record of history of this era. To fill the gap left by photographers at the time, today's cinematographers have tapped into the research of Civil War battlefield experts. With the aid of war journals and artifacts, these experts have helped American filmmakers portray the war in realistic terms.

After 180 hours of laboratory experiments, and having volunteers drink 285 cups of tea, the experts came to some definite conclusions. To brew the best possible cup of tea, start with 200 ml, or 6.8 ounces, of fresh water and bring it to a boil before pouring it into a cup. Add the tea bag, let it steep for two minutes, and then remove the bag. If you like milk in your tea, add it just after you remove the tea bag. Then, bide your time for six minutes before drinking to let it come to the perfect temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit. It appears the mystery of how to make a great cup of tea has been solved!

Placed in salty, lukewarm water, the dried cysts rehydrate and begin hatching. Under ideal conditions, it takes them about eight days to reach adulthood, growing to about half an inch long. Aquarium hobbyists easily raise them as fish food, but in nature, they are found in salty lakes such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Because conditions in the Great Salt Lake are not ideal for brine shrimp, it takes them from three to six weeks to reach maturity. Even so, the brine shrimp population in the Great Salt Lake can produce four or more generations per year. Geologic core samples from the Great Salt Lake reveal brine shrimp cysts that were deposited up to 600,000 years ago. Amazing creatures indeed!

Hurtling at about 150,000 miles per hour, the dust particles become vaporized, leaving ionized gas trails that glow for a few seconds. People call them falling stars, but they are actually the debris that comets leave in a trail behind them. Each year in late April or early May, as Earth passes through the orbital path of Halley's Comet, many small, otherwise unseen bits of dust still zooming along in Halley's pathway bombard our atmosphere. If the sky is clear, we can witness these tiny meteors light up the sky as they crash and burn in our atmosphere. In the fall, when Earth passes through the opposite side of Halley's orbital path, we have another chance to watch a meteor shower.

He worked all day in the fields, like his neighbors, and he looked like the other farmers in the neighborhood when he stood around with them at church suppers, discussing the weather and the crops, but he was not like them. So far as the other farmers were concerned, there was only one good way of doing things and that was the way they had always been done, as far back as anybody could remember. Mr. Marvell was always discovering something new, always trying something out.

The crown jewel of the treasure trove was said to be a pyramid of gold bars as big as a house. The immensity of the treasure made no difference, of course; we dared not go near the cave because, as we were frequently warned, it was haunted by spectral guardians. These terrifying spirits would wait there until their crewmates arrived to divvy up the loot.

This pest has been around for over 170 million years, and more than 175 known species of mosquitos live in the United States. If you're outside playing volleyball, you're likely to be a target for mosquitoes. The reason for this is that mosquitoes sense movement, carbon dioxide, and the lactic acid from sweat glands. The more active you are, the more carbon dioxide you exhale, which mosquitoes can smell from 50 meters away. Chances are that if you're outside you'll be moving around. You may want to consider a repellent to ward off the pests. Insect repellents containing chemical repellents are effective; nonchemical repellents that contain volatile plant oils, such as those that derive from citronella, eucalyptus, and rosemary are effective but for shorter lengths of time -- usually only about two hours at most. So, find your favorite insect repellant and get ready for volleyball!

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	warn people about the dangers of mosquito bites.

The sentence should be ""Maria went with Jim and me to the meeting."" An easy way to tell which way is correct is to leave out the other person. You wouldn't say, for example, ""Maria went with I to the meeting."" Rather, you'd say, ""Maria went with me to the meeting."" Just because another person is included in the sentence doesn't change the rules. In this case, because the pronoun is the object of the preposition with, it should be me instead of I. But since such rules are not easy to keep in mind, the easiest way to be correct is to hear yourself say the sentence without including the other person. Then you'll nearly always know whether to say me or I.

The battle -- the first on foreign soil for the Marine Corps -- was won.  O'Bannon's successful campaign restored Pasha Hamet, the leader of the Mamelukes, a class of warriors that ruled Egypt at the time, to his throne.

Peacekeepers are soldiers who enter the world's most dangerous areas and often find themselves squarely in the potential crossfire of parties eager to resume war. Their guns -- if they have any -- are loaded with the hope that they never be fired and only used in self-defense. Their helmets, like nothing in their surroundings, are sky blue, not meant to be camouflaged, but seen. Their vehicles are also a very conspicuous white with a large ""U.N."" painted on them. The countries to which peacekeepers are deployed are never their own, which means they have no personal stake in a conflict's outcome, no family or friends to defend, no proud nationalistic compulsion that drives them. Amid strangers and violence, their mission is to provide impartial security and peacebuilding support to help countries make the difficult transition from war to peace.

He described Atlantis as being extremely wealthy and advanced in architecture and engineering, leading many to fantasize about discovering lost, unimaginable treasures. Many have concluded, however, that Atlantis was merely a fictional device used by Plato to demonstrate how greed and pettiness -- which overcame the people of Atlantis -- can destroy even the most successful civilizations.

The discovery of these four moons, named Io, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa, provided additional support for the idea that the sun, not Earth, is at the center of our solar system. Although that discovery occurred about 400 years ago, Jupiter's moon Europa continues to hold great interest. Europa's surface is mostly solid water ice, largely frozen due to its great distance from the sun. But due to its elliptical orbit, Europa has tidal forces in constant motion and, as a result, heat. This warmth, combined with the large amount of water and, from the water, oxygen, has led many to advocate for Europa's exploration as a prime candidate for hosting extraterrestrial life.

More than one lay among the roots of the forest trees; and others, again, kept us company on the highway, running clear and bubbling through the ditches by the roadside.

His poems presented a musical quality, but they were also to be experienced visually; the stanzas and lines were often arranged irregularly upon the page. Obscured, or perhaps disguised, by these eccentricities, however, was his use of one of the most traditional forms of poetry: the sonnet. Cultivated in the thirteenth century by Sicilian and Tuscan poets, sonnets are poems with 14 lines that follow a strict rhyme scheme. Many of Cummings' poems -- with their internal, seemingly arbitrary rhymes and broken, oddly spaced lines -- can be ""reconfigured"" into perfectly composed sonnets. Although known as an avant-gardist who pushed boundaries, Cummings was also a legitimate traditionalist whose themes of love and war align with the great sonnet writers of history.

One rule of thumb is to avoid blind spots around trucks. If you can't see the truck's side-view mirrors from behind a truck, it is possible the truck driver cannot see you. Abruptly cutting in front of a truck is dangerous because trucks require more distance to slow down and stop. When you need to pass a truck, make sure you use your blinker, and that the truck's entire cab can be seen in your rearview mirror before you pull in front. In wet weather, give trucks extra space.

Which of the following best summarizes the passage?

A.	Drivers should use extra precautions around trucks on highways.
B.	It's possible that truck drivers may not see drivers behind them.
C.	Be cautious when striving to get past large trucks on highways.
D.	If you are a driver, you will eventually drive on the highway.

One legend tells that each mineral or gemstone had maximum power during one of the twelve months of the year. According to this legend, the gem for the month of November, for example, is topaz. The folklore associated with topaz included the idea that it could prevent sudden death, improve the eyesight, and that it was a remedy for insanity. Topaz was also said to help balance the emotions to help protect the wearer from succumbing to the temptation of greed. Other gems had different properties. For example, sapphires were thought to protect kings from harm and envy. People who couldn't afford to buy all twelve purchased only the mineral that offered protection during their birth month. Some think this is the origin of the birthstone.

Based on the passage, the author's attitude toward birthstones is

The Leaning Tower of Pisa, famous for its southward tilt, has been in danger of collapsing several times during its existence. Construction of this eight-story bell tower began in 1173. By the time the builders reached the third story, the foundation had already begun to settle unevenly on the soft soil, and the unfinished tower was already leaning. Due to political unrest, construction ceased for almost a hundred years. When the project was restarted, the soil had shifted, making the tower lean the other way. Construction was finally completed in the late 1300s, but in subsequent centuries the structure continued to lean to an ever greater degree until it inclined 5.5 degrees -- 17 feet off vertical. Various efforts to prevent the tower from falling were tried, and in 1989, an English soil mechanics expert finally succeeded in making it more vertical and stable than it has ever been.

In discussing the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the author's primary focus is on

By this, Jung meant that in addition to an individual's personal memory, all people have in common a collective, or universal, memory inherited from our ancestors. This collective unconscious is revealed in patterns he called ""archetypes"" shared by all human civilizations throughout history. Although archetypes are internal, everyone projects and applies them to make sense of the outside world. Common archetypes include the nurturing and loving mother; the demanding and rewarding father; the strong and capable hero; the wise old man; the helpless infant; the dangerous, unpredictable wild man; the fair maiden; the trickster; and the shadow, which refers to the evil and repressed parts of everyone's personality. Even though no one person fits neatly into one archetype, the collective unconscious, according to Jung, organizes and informs human and societal thought and behavior.

These included covering the tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly, or touching it with something hot. Healthcare professionals, however, recommend against these practices. The most important thing is to remove the tick as quickly as possible. As soon as a tick is spotted, grasp it with fine-tipped tweezers as close to the skin's surface as possible. Then gently pull upward without twisting or jerking. If the mouthparts break off and remain in the skin, try to remove them with clean tweezers. If they won't come out, leave them; the skin will heal. Clean the bite area with soap, wash your hands, and you're done. This procedure might lack the drama of folk remedies, but it prevents tick bites from getting worse.

The last few decades have seen the rise of the graphic novel, a form of literature similar to comic books, but which offers, like traditional novels, intricate narratives and complex characters. Will Eisner's A Contract with God, published in 1978, is widely considered to be the first graphic novel and, since its publication, the form has become increasingly popular. As more and more readers are recognizing the graphic novel as a bona fide literary and artistic medium, its rise in popularity is similar to the appeal of the traditional novel before it replaced poetry as the preferred medium for high literary art. Though they may not displace traditional novels, graphic novels are capturing the attention of readers of all ages. The genre has even been the subject of special topics courses in university English programs across the country.

They are also one of only a few North American songbirds that have nest helpers -- usually males from the previous year's offspring -- that support and assist parents when raising their young. These helpers perform vital activities, such as protecting the nest and feeding the female and the brood. On cold winter nights, Pygmy Nuthatches group themselves close together in cavities to keep warm. Since they survive by living with their extended families and others, it's common to see groups of them together.

Our attention is drawn to particular parts of the image -- to certain figures or actions -- which propel the narrative captured in the picture or which convey certain information to the viewer. Certainly the artist wants to be sure that the audience pays the most attention to the important elements -- such as the focal point -- in the image rather than decorative or background elements. In this lesson students will learn about repetition, one of the techniques artists often use to highlight important elements within a painting's composition, and to move a viewer's eye around the canvas, from highpoint to highpoint.

First, I consider what mood I would like the room to have. For example, if I want my kitchen to have a sociable, lively feel, I would go with brighter colors. For a more relaxed, quiet feeling, I would choose neutral colors. Next, I always test my color choices before making my purchase. I tape paint swatches to the walls of the room and look at them at different times of day to see how the paint looks in natural and artificial light. Finally, I consider different types of paint finishes. The same color can look very different with a matte, satin, or glossy finish. By following this plan, I've ended up with walls that look great.

Federal protection of endangered species dates back to the Lacey Act of 1900, when Congress passed the first wildlife law in response to growing public concern over the decline of the passenger pigeon. The Lacey Act prohibited interstate importing, exporting, selling or acquisition of animals killed illegally. As public awareness of environmental problems led to political activism in the 1960s, the Department of the Interior formed a Committee on Rare and Endangered Wildlife Species to identify species in immediate danger of extinction. The Redbook on Rare and Endangered Fish and Wildlife of the United States, published in 1964, served as the first official document listing species the federal government considered to be in danger of extinction. Two years after the Redbook list was published, Congress passed the Endangered Species Protection Act of 1966 -- the first piece of comprehensive endangered species legislation.

Published in 1922, ""The Waste Land"" is a five-part poem with a deliberately irregular form that includes multiple speakers, haphazard partial rhyme schemes and short sections of traditional structure. This form has a disorienting effect and is meant to reflect Europe's ravaged post-war condition, described in the poem as ""a heap of broken images."" European culture, once great and glorious, has decayed and withered, and Europeans, the poem's form suggests, are forced to live in this ""waste land"" amid reminders (i.e., ""broken images"") of its greatness. At times macabre and somber, ""The Waste Land"" accurately expresses the disillusionment of a world in violent transition, while also functioning as a bridge from nineteenth-century traditional poetry to twentieth-century modernism.

Pulling oneself up sheer rock cliffs leaves no room for a distracted or wandering mind. Even for experienced rock climbers, the risk of falling is always present. To keep everyone safe, specialized equipment such as ropes, quickdraws, carabiners, and camming devices, as well as safety procedures have been developed to prevent falls. However, beginners, who start with bouldering, need only a good pair of hiking shoes and a crash pad that can cushion them when they're ready to jump down from the rocks. In bouldering, climbers stay fairly close to the ground, often moving across rocks horizontally.

When the writer lived in the open country several years ago he went to Mifflin Center school and attended Wesley Chapel church. The schoolhouse and the church were located at the same crossroads, and these two institutions drew for their constituency from an area of about four square miles for the school and a somewhat larger area for the church. Brownstown school, to the south, Hendrickson's to the east, and Whetstone to the west made up other school communities. Pleasant Grove church, Salem, and Brownstown, with a different territory covered by each, made up church areas that did not coincide with the school areas bounding Mifflin Center school territory.

Though its leathery skin can make it difficult to eat, the pomegranate is very nutritious. Packed with antioxidants, pomegranates are a great source of potassium and vitamin C and are highly versatile in cooking. The seeds, each surrounded by a rich red jelly known as an aril, can be added to salads and entrees for an extra crunch and punch of color. The aril alone is used in making pomegranate juice, which is one of the fruit's most popular applications. Soups, stews, and sauces can also be enhanced with pomegranate seeds, as they add a sweet, tart edge to savory dishes. In addition, whole pomegranates have a long shelf life, as long as a few months if kept refrigerated, so there is good reason to stock up.

According to the passage, one reason people dislike pomegranates is because of their

A.	seeds.
B.	tart taste.

No one would have guessed the profound impact this event would have on sight-impaired people across the world. At the time, the only books for the blind had large, embossed letters; to read them, a blind person would have to feel the shape of each letter. Reading was a difficult and slow process. But in 1821, Charles Barbier, a former soldier, visited the school to share a secret military code he had invented. It was a system of raised dots on paper that proved too difficult for military use. However, learning the code was not too difficult for Braille. Over the next three years, Braille simplified Barbier's system significantly, perfecting it into an easy reading system that blind people still use today.

Different species of birds have different feeding habits. Some are insect eaters, some seed eaters. Some get their food from the water, some from the ground, others from the trees, and some are birds of prey. Birds like the Downy Woodpecker, Nuthatch, Creeper, Chickadee and Titmouse, get their insect food from the trunks and branches of the trees, while the Vireos, most of the Warblers, the Orioles and others, search the foliage for their insect food. These birds may be looked for among the trees and shrubs. The Meadowlark, Towhee, Grackle, Robin, Water-thrush, Dickcissel and Quail are types of birds that get their food from the ground, and so far as food alone is concerned, they might well be found in either field or wood.

If you ever examine the early Chinese vases in the Fogg Museum or elsewhere, you will note that many of them have little cracks in the glaze which run every which way. You might conclude that these were caused by antique methods of firing the pottery, or are just the result of old age. Actually these cracks, which are known as crackle in the glaze, were made on purpose. For it seems that these vases were often given as New Year's presents, and since New Year's is celebrated by the Chinese in the spring, the crackle was made to represent the breaking-up of the ice on the rivers and lakes, the change from the hard and fastness of winter to the movement of spring.

To begin, pour some cream into a blender, and blend it at a medium speed for about five minutes. It will become whipped cream, but as you continue blending it, you'll start seeing pale yellow, almost white chunks of butter swirling in the liquid -- that is buttermilk. Turn off the blender and let the butter rise to the top of the container. Then drain the buttermilk, pressing out as much as possible. Add a cup of ice cold water and blend for another thirty seconds. This is called washing the butter. If you skip this step, your butter will go rancid within a few days. Next, drain the water, pressing out as much as possible. Scoop the butter into a dish. Some people like to add salt, but it's optional. Store it in the refrigerator.

Carved into the landscape by the Colorado River over the course of millions of years, it extends 277 miles through the state of Arizona. At its widest point the canyon is 18 miles across and at its deepest, it dips a full mile from its topmost edge to the river below. Billions of years of geological history can be found within the towering walls of the canyon, still being eroded today by the continual flow of the Colorado. The richness of the canyon is demonstrated by the variety of habitats found within it, ranging from lush, green montane forests to scorching desert. Because of this variety, it is home to more than 350 bird species, as well as 145 mammalian, reptilian, and amphibian species. Scientists have actively studied the canyon for over 150 years, beginning with John Strong Newberry in 1858, and are still unravelling the canyon's many mysteries.

But as the number of factories multiplied and the child workforce grew, the social conscience began to stir -- not against child labor itself, but against some features of the factory system as they affected the children. The earliest concerns were that factory children were growing up without receiving even a modest education. Long workdays and workweeks left little time for study. In 1813, Connecticut enacted a law encouraging manufacturers to provide young employees with lessons in reading, writing, and arithmetic, but the law was ineffective. However, in 1836, Massachusetts passed this country's first child labor law -- legislation that required children under the age of 15 who were employed in manufacturing to spend at least 3 months each year in school.

The belt, far more ornate than the cumbersome wrapping, was made of many small chains linking metal plates and supported a long dagger which hung straight in front. The man also wore a round blue cloak, now swept back on his shoulders to free his bare arms, which was fastened by a large pin under his chin. His footgear, which extended above his calves, was made of animal hide, still bearing patches of shaggy hair. His face was beardless, though a shadowy line along his chin suggested that he had not shaved that particular day. A fur cap concealed most of his dark-brown hair.

Storm-clouds were gathering thickly overhead, and the ground beneath was covered with rustling leaves, which, blighted by the early frosts, lay helpless and dead at the roadside, or were made the sport of the wind. A solitary horseman was slowly plodding along the road but a few miles from the village of Salem. In truth he was so near to the famous Puritan village, that, through the hills and intervening tree-tops, he could have seen the spires of the churches had he raised his melancholy eyes from the ground. The rider was not a youth, nor had he reached middle age. His face was handsome, though distorted with agony. Occasionally he pressed his hand to his side as if in pain; but maugre pain, weariness, or anguish, he pressed on, admonished by the lengthening shadows of the approach of night. Turning his great, sad, brown eyes at last to where the road wound about the valley across which the distant spires of Salem could be seen, he sighed.

All of these diamonds were formed deep in Earth's crust under intense heat and pressure. Found in several countries across four continents, they were brought up to Earth's surface during volcanic explosions. But there is another type of diamond that seems to defy the rules for where most diamonds are found. Called carbonados, these diamonds are black, and have been found only in Brazil, Borneo, Siberia, and central Africa -- in places where conventional diamonds are not found. Research conducted on black diamonds reveals the presence of hydrogen in their structure, which seems to indicate that they were formed in a hydrogen-rich interstellar location; that is, they were likely formed during stellar supernovae explosions. Scientists theorize black diamonds landed on Earth four billion years ago, when asteroids were constantly battering our young planet.

But there are some trees that seem to have grown into impossible shapes: ladders, arches, double helixes, chairs, pretzels, baskets, and even human forms. Such fantastic trees didn't get that way on their own, of course; their shapes are the result of years of patient, careful attention and skill by tree gardeners. Sometimes called arborsculpture, these amazing, live art forms require skilled expertise in grafting, bending, and training young branches. Over the years, as the trees continue growing, their bark eventually conceals the grafting scars, giving a smooth, organic appearance.

Typically made of ceramic, and looking like a hungry bird with its head tilted back and its beak wide open, pie birds, also called pie vents, are also available in other shapes. A pie bird is usually placed in the center of the bottom crust of a two-crust fruit pie. The filling is piled around it and the pie bird sticks out through a hole in the center of the top crust, allowing steam to vent through the bird's mouth during baking. By venting the pie this way, the juices from the fruit being baked inside don't bubble out of the sides of the pie and onto the oven floor, creating a sticky, baked-on mess. Venting steam with a pie bird also prevents the top crust from getting soggy.

Based on the passage, the author's main point is that pie birds

A full half-century before Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote his first tale about Sherlock Holmes, Poe had created the great detective Auguste Dupin. Literary scholars have noted numerous parallels between Poe's Dupin and Doyle's Holmes. Both of them have sidekicks that tell their stories, and both of these sidekicks are amazed and dismayed each time their detective friend solves a case.

Slow as the season is in its developing process, invisible as is the growth which your little plants do really make from day to day, it is well that there is so much other work to do in the garden besides watching them. Work which cannot wait, and so makes our waiting easier. First go over the grass of lawn and edgings, and have bare spots resodded or broken up and sprinkled with grass seed and clover: even a light dressing of fine barnyard manure will do much. All rubbish of sticks and stones -- the drift of winter storms -- should have been raked off long ago. Dig up any wild onions that show their presumptuous heads, getting the start of the grass, and if sorrel appears here and there, give it such a dusting with wood-ashes that it will be glad to hide. Just now, while merely in leaf, you notice it less; but by and by, when it is in flower, the red patches will spoil the lawn effect, pretty as they may be in themselves.

Beside her, Peter, his stiff black hair tousled and his red lips parted over his tiny teeth, still slept. Katrinka, shivering, tucked the blanket more closely about his shoulders. It was unusually cold, even for Russia. The top of the big oven, where she and Peter had spent the night, was barely warm. Katrinka leaned forward, her eyes on the two small windows with their tiny panes of glass. A fine, sandy snow was falling. The light in the room was gray and cheerless, the house wrapped in silence. Katrinka felt suddenly lonely and afraid. ""Mamusia,"" she called softly. There was no answer. She called again, then waited. All was silent. Katrinka bit her under lip, thoughtfully.

It was the jackal -- Tabaqui, the Dish-licker -- and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. They are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of any one, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way. Even the tiger hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee -- the madness -- and run.

The author most likely wrote the passage about Tabaqui in order to

A.	inspire pity for him.
B.	portray him as brave.

Few things sound as good as a candy bar in the late afternoon, when lunch was hours ago and dinner is still hours away. In the past year, I've found a solution to my afternoon snacking. Just as I pack my lunch each day, I now pack my afternoon snack. Also, I never pack the same snack twice in a single week. For example, this week I've eaten multigrain chips topped with cheddar. I've also had a pear with a dab of sour cream along with a couple slices of turkey, brown rice topped with salsa, fruit kebobs drizzled with dark chocolate, and a whole wheat pita topped with hummus. If I'm still hungry afterwards, I'll drink a cup of tea. This routine has helped me stay away from unhealthy snacking each afternoon.

The main idea of the passage is

A.	the author has a lot of recipes for healthy snacks.
B.	that healthy snacks are a good substitute for lunch or dinner.
C.	by using this snack plan, the author no longer has the urge for candy bars.
D.	the author is creative in preparing snacks to make it easier to eat healthier.

I give most of the credit to a German inventor named Charles Weisenthal. In 1755, he created the first sewing machine needle. However, in 1790 a British inventor, Thomas Saint, patented the first workable sewing machine. Yet some people hesitate to give him credit; people claim the patent was issued, but a working prototype of his machine was never built. Following these two men, many others have created, built, and patented different types of sewing machines and parts. So if you're wondering why I give most of the credit to Weisenthal, it's because he invented what I believe is the most important part of a sewing machine -- the needle.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	offer new evidence about who invented the first sewing machine.
B.	discredit the idea that Thomas Saint invented the sewing machine.
C.	argue that Weisenthal deserves most of the credit for inventing the sewing machine.
D.	summarize the history of the many inventors who contributed to the modern sewing machine.

The most important part of making cappuccino is getting the milk just right. You should first insert a steam wand into a small metal pitcher of cold milk. Do not bob the pitcher up and down as you see on television and in coffee shops. Instead, carefully watch the milk foam and lower the pitcher as the milk rises. Invest in a thermometer so you'll know when the milk reaches the correct temperature -- 148 to 155 degrees. When it does, make your espresso. Allow your milk to settle for fifteen seconds and swirl the milk and foam together. Don't use a spoon. Simply swirl the pitcher until the milk and foam are combined. You'll know it's ready when the milk's surface is shiny. Finally, pour the perfect milk on top of the espresso and tah-dah! Enjoy the deliciousness of a perfect cappuccino.

According to the passage, what does the author recommend doing immediately before the milk's surface becomes shiny?

A.	Insert a steam wand into the pitcher.
B.	Lower the pitcher as the milk rises.
C.	Swirl the milk and foam.
D.	Make the espresso.

They have long antennae and large rear legs. They're most active at night and can force their way into homes, although they are most commonly found outdoors. What are they? Crickets! What is it about these insects that startle me most? It's their chirping. The males chirp by rubbing their wings together. This noise not only keeps me awake at night, but it invades my dreams when I finally fall asleep. Many people can ignore the sounds or become so accustomed to it that they don't even realize they're hearing chirping. I, on the other hand, have never become used to the noise.

Based on the passage, the author's attitude toward crickets is best described as

Plants can purify the air you breathe, increase the humidity in a room, and even boost your concentration and productivity. Houseplants can also improve your health. One research study suggests that patients recovering from surgery in hospital rooms with plants and flowers not only had lower blood pressure but also less pain, anxiety, and fatigue than patients in rooms without plants and flowers. Other studies have suggested benefits to bringing plants into the workplace. Working around plants can decrease fatigue, headaches, colds, and other flu-like symptoms. Plants may also reduce stress and absences from work. With so many advantages to adding houseplants to your environment, it's difficult to imagine why you wouldn't.

In the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to

A.	criticize people for not having houseplants.

When it was snowing last winter, I took my slides and their cover slips outside and allowed them to become cold. I placed a piece of cardboard on the ground and used it to collect flakes. Then, with a magnifying glass I looked at the collected flakes until I identified some that had interesting shapes. I carefully picked up several flakes with a small paintbrush and placed them on my slides. Using cold super glue, I dripped a drop onto the flakes. Some of the flakes melted right away; I accidentally damaged others with the brush, but a few of them remained intact. Next, I brought my slides inside my home and stored them in the freezer for two weeks. When I took them out and put them under my microscope, I was impressed. I had successfully preserved snowflake crystals. Now, I have snowflakes I can look at whenever I choose.

The blue devils were swarming so thick around me that I didn't want to fight them in the close quarters of my stateroom. But at last I had to go below, and the night that followed was a terror.

He was leaving New York long before most of his friends could get away. He did not know just where he was going, and preferred not to know. He wished to have a complete holiday, and to see Europe as an idle tourist, and not as an artist with an eye to his own improvement.

As he looked out over the spectacular view, he ate a handful of dried sloe berries, a little meat, and some chunks of bread. While there, however, he slipped into a glacial crevasse where he remained for centuries, frozen and perfectly preserved. In 1991, due to glacial melting, his body began to be exposed, and two Austrian hikers found him. Otzi the Iceman, as he has been called, is now the subject of intense scientific study. He was a sturdy but short fellow at about 5' 2"" and 134 pounds. Probably in his mid-40s, Otzi may have spent his life herding sheep and goats, but his preserved remains provide us one of the most detailed examples of the clothing, tools, behavior, and diet of humans who lived during the Late Neolithic age.

When he was 16, his family moved to North Carolina. Five years later Boone fought in the French and Indian War and was lucky to have escaped with his life. After the war, he returned to his home in North Carolina, where he married and supported his family by trapping and hunting. In 1775, Boone most memorably helped to create the Wilderness Road when he led a contingency of axmen who blazed a trail west through the Cumberland Gap, where Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee meet. He later settled his family in Kentucky before making his final move to Missouri, where he died in 1820.

Described as a giant of a man, Bunyan overcame impossible obstacles with ease. Some of his larger-than-life feats include creating the Grand Canyon when he dragged his axe in the dirt; the 10,000 lakes of Minnesota were formed when Bunyan and his enormous ox, Babe, walked through the state. In 1910, a reporter collected and published the various tales of Bunyan, assuring the character's place in American mythology. Four years later, a lumber company featured Paul Bunyan in an advertising campaign, which further enshrined his place in the American cultural landscape. Unlike many characters in American folklore, there is no European counterpart to Bunyan and his ox. To this day, the tall tales of Bunyan and his exploits continue to capture the imagination.

Born in Kansas in 1897, Amelia graduated from high school in 1915 and began attending a ""finishing school"" in Pennsylvania. While visiting her sister in Canada, she decided to stay, becoming a volunteer nurse at a military hospital in Toronto during WWI. Earhart often visited the local air field and thus began her love affair with flying. After the war was over, she returned to the States and briefly enrolled in a pre-med program before doing stints as a social worker, English tutor, and fashion designer. She won distinction for being the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, albeit as a passenger. Two years after the transatlantic flight, she earned her own pilot's license and began setting records piloting various aircraft.

Prior to 19th century western expansion, bison were so great in number that it was believed impossible to reduce their population. Often delaying trains by being in the way, and occasionally being aggressive around travelers, the bison acquired a negative reputation. Settlers, many traversing the newly opened Oregon Trail, killed the animals in great numbers, unaware that within a century the bison would be all but gone because of their actions. Additionally, overgrazing by domesticated livestock took its toll, stripping the plains of the bison's natural food sources, and displacing herds. By the late 1800s, only about a thousand bison remained in the wild. Conservation efforts followed, and though the bison population has rebounded as a result of these efforts, most are not pure wild bison, but rather a mix between bison and cattle.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	The reduction of bison habitat was more destructive than hunting.
B.	The hybrid bison that exist today are hardier than the original bison.
C.	The bison's negative reputation probably added to its being over hunted.

His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.

Britons visiting America in the early 1800s were astonished to see their hosts eating from the blades of knives. Forks, other than the two-tined variety used for cooking, had yet to be universally embraced on the western shores of the Atlantic. Before forks became popular in Europe, hands and knives were the most common means of getting food into one's mouth. It wasn't until the fifteenth century that Italian nobility began using forks, but it would be almost 150 years before forks would become widely used throughout Europe. England didn't use forks until sometime in the 1700s. It wasn't until the 1850s that three-tined forks became commonplace on American dining tables; currently, four-tined models are in fashion.

A naturally retiring, modest disposition, and two external causes are the reasons for Muller's humbleness of manner, which is his chief characteristic.

She made it in big flat cakes with a hole in the middle, strung these cakes on a stick and hung the stick high up in the hut where the cakes would dry and harden, and could be kept for a long time. If the yarn brought a good price, she might even buy some sour milk, too. Potatoes they got from a tiny fenced-in field, no larger than the floor of a small room.

Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge in Delaware is a great place to go if you want to learn about and watch these large flying predators. In Bombay Hook you'll see for yourself that these birds of prey, or raptors, are specifically suited to their lives as hunters. Their strong legs and powerful grasping feet with sharp talons help them catch and kill prey. Hooked bills help tear the meat. The winter at the refuge is a good time to look for a variety of raptors. Northern harriers fly over the salt marsh and fields. Look for the eastern screech owl sitting in the hole of a wood duck box. Bald eagles, red-tailed and Cooper's hawks can be spotted on tree branches. Maybe you'll even get to see a raptor swoop down to catch its next meal.

Based on the passage, raptors are particularly well-suited as predators because of their

A.	ability to withstand winters.
B.	flying speed and agility.
C.	preference for rodents.

Measuring between 209 and 505 cm in length, adult male hippos can weigh up to 6,400 pounds. Hippos spend most of their time in water -- up to 16 hours a day -- keeping their large bodies cool in the hot African climate. With their eyes and nose located on the top of their head, hippos can lie almost completely submerged in the water. Hippos do not have sweat glands, but secrete a clear substance that turns red when exposed to sunlight and acts as a natural sunscreen. When not in water, this substance keeps their skin from chapping and cracking, and helps protect against bacterial diseases.

According to the passage, what enables hippos to spend a significant amount of time almost completely submerged underwater?

A.	the location of their eyes and nose

Archaeologists believe the mounds fulfilled ceremonial purposes, in addition to acting as burial grounds. Over the years, land has been cleared, highways have been constructed, and buildings have been built, destroying most of these mounds. However, in the 1950s and 1960s, citizens were successful in convincing the state to purchase 1,200 acres of land that still contains at least 15 of the Native American mounds. In 1974, the land became an official state park called Pinson Mounds State Archeological Park. It is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places where it will forever be protected and preserved.

He planted a five-pound willow sapling in a pot with exactly 200 pounds of dried soil. After five years of watering and tending the willow, van Helmont carefully uprooted and weighed it. The tree then weighed 169 pounds. After drying the soil, he found it weighed only two ounces less than the original 200 pounds. The accumulation of the additional 164 pounds of the tree's weight, van Helmont could plainly see, had not come from the soil. But since he understood nothing about how plants use water and sunlight to generate new plant tissue from carbon dioxide in the air -- photosynthesis -- van Helmont concluded, incorrectly, that the tree's increased mass was due only to water.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

A.	The role of carbon dioxide in plant growth was unknown at the time.

Resistant to pollution and pests, the gingko is tough. But more than that, the gingko is a living fossil; that is, present day gingkos are the sole surviving descendants of trees that lived beyond the time of the dinosaurs more than 200 million years ago. Among all plants, gingkos have no living relatives, and constitute the only one of their genus. Fossils of many varieties of gingkos are found in rocks from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, but today's gingko is the only survivor of what was once a larger family of trees, and has remained unchanged since those ancient times. Extremely long-lived, the oldest living gingko is now more than 3,500 years old.

Though manufacturing progress was made during this period, numerous skilled workers were rendered obsolete by new technologies and techniques. Those working in the textile industry were some of the first to be affected, along with those employed in agriculture, metalwork, and the transportation of goods. As a result, wages dropped due to the rise in the newly unemployed, and businesses, left to operate without any government oversight, neglected to maintain satisfactory working conditions for employees. The lack of regulations also meant that factories were free to hire children, who were often given highly dangerous tasks that made use of their small frames. Though the cost of progress was high, much was learned from those trying times. Conditions, wages, and worker safety improved and continue to improve even today as a result of the many lessons gathered from that era.

At 8,611 meters, K2 is the tallest mountain in the region, and three others within 20 km top 8,000 meters. The Karakoram and the nearby Himalaya range (the tallest mountain range on Earth) are important to Earth scientists. They are one of the world's most geologically active areas, at the boundary between two colliding continents. Therefore, they are important in the study of plate tectonics. Mountain glaciers may serve as an indicator of climate change, advancing and receding with long-term changes in temperature and precipitation. These extensive ranges may have even caused climate change when they were formed over 40 million years ago. The large amounts of rock exposed to the atmosphere are weathered (broken down) by carbon dioxide. This process removes the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, and could have caused the global climate to cool, triggering an ongoing series of ice ages.

In discussing the Karakoram and Himalaya mountain ranges, the author's primary focus is on their

A.	history.

For much of its course, the river moves lazily through wide valleys, but as it enters the border region between Romania and Serbia, its banks narrow into a series of high cliffs. Here, the river carved a passage through the lower Carpathian Mountains to its north and the Balkan Mountains to its south, creating a series of four steep gorges. These gorges are known as the Iron Gate. The river's narrowest point as it passes through the gorges is at Great Kazan gorge. Within the gorge, the Danube shrinks to 150 meters in width and is flanked by limestone cliffs that reach to about 300 meters. The cliffs are a darker shade of red on the east bank of the river and are accented with dark shadows. After exiting the gorge, the river widens again as it enters the Orsova Valley. A ""u"" bend brings the Danube into the last gorge, the Sip Gorge. Within this last of the four gorges is the Danube's second iron gate: the Iron Gate Dam.

Located in northern Pakistan, Nanga Parbat is the westernmost of the eight-thousanders (the 14 peaks above 8,000 meters). Despite being geographically close to the Karakoram range in Pakistan, it actually represents the westernmost part of the Himalayan range. Meaning ""naked mountain"" in Urdu, Nanga Parbat is a reference to the generally snow-free south face. Known as the Rupal face, this is the world's largest rock wall, rising some 4,700 meters from its base to the summit. The other faces -- the Rakhiot face and the western Diamir -- are also extreme. In the first-ever attempt to climb an eight-thousander, British mountaineer Albert Mummery ascended Nanga Parbat in 1895. Of the south face, he wrote: ""The astounding difficulties of the southern face may be realized by the fact that the gigantic rock-ridges, the dangers of the hanging glacier and the steep ice of the north-west face -- one of the most terrifying faces of a mountain I have ever seen -- are preferable to the south face.""

There wasn't a thing in it but dirt and the wreck of an old stove and a few handfuls of wormy cornmeal Frank found in a bag on a shelf. The place must have been built by somebody who'd tried to prove upon a desert claim. There was a sort of tumbledown lean-to shed back of the shack. That's what kept the boys from freezing until the snow packed them in. It was warmer then, though the air got awful. Somehow Frank managed a fire in that old stove -- managed to break up for fuel the wood of that lean-to with only his hands and an old rusty hatchet head he found. The stove smoked awfully and snow kept coming down into it. There was hardly any chimney outside, and the roof got piled high with snow. It leaked dreadfully, too, especially around where the stove was, below. The wind had torn off most of the tar-paper roofing before the snow began to pile up. And the one window was broken out and the snow kept coming in.

The bill is reviewed by a committee; if it passes review, the bill is then scheduled to be voted on, debated, or amended. If it is approved by a simple majority -- 218 of the 435 representatives -- the bill moves to the Senate, where it is assigned to another committee for further review. Should it pass this review, the Senate votes on, debates, or amends it. When a simple majority of senators -- 51 of 100 -- passes the bill, it is assigned to a final committee composed of senators and representatives; their task is to reconcile any discrepancies between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Once reconciled, the final bill is returned to both Houses of Congress for final approval before being submitted to the president, who has 10 days to either sign or veto it.

In a single afternoon, they invented a poet named ""Ern Malley"" and constructed several nonsensical poems, lifting phrases from random books and splicing them together arbitrarily. They submitted the poems to the leading modernist journal of the day, Angry Penguins. Impressed by Ern Malley's poems, the journal's editor, modernist poet Max Harris, published a special issue of Angry Penguins dedicated entirely to Ern Malley's poetry. When the hoax was exposed the following year, Harris was humiliated and modernism in Australia suffered a huge setback. Many, however, defended the merit of Ern Malley's poems, arguing that genuineness in poetry is not dependent on authorial sincerity. Ironically, the Ern Malley poems are more widely read today than the work of McAuley and Stewart.

I expected to receive a powerful esthetic pleasure, but having read, one after the other, works regarded as his best: ""King Lear,"" ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Hamlet"" and ""Macbeth,"" not only did I feel no delight, but I felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium, and doubted as to whether I was senseless in feeling works regarded as the summit of perfection by the whole of the civilized world to be trivial and positively bad, or whether the significance which this civilized world attributes to the works of Shakespeare was itself senseless. My consternation was increased by the fact that I always keenly felt the beauties of poetry in every form; then why should artistic works recognized by the whole world as those of a genius, -- the works of Shakespeare, -- not only fail to please me, but be disagreeable to me?

Ligers are the biggest feline in the world, averaging about 1,000 pounds; tigons are generally smaller than either of their parents. Ligers and tigons exhibit characteristics and features of both lions and tigers. Ligers, for instance, make the sounds of both a lion and a tiger. Although both hybrids have spots and stripes, tigons more closely resemble tigers with their deep orange coats and white bellies. Ligers are more golden or sand-colored, and male ligers have manes. Because tigers and lions live naturally in separate habitats, ligers and tigons are not found in the wild. Without human-controlled environments, the crossbreeding of these two large cats would never have happened. Some are opposed to crossbreeding these two animals in part because many ligers and tigons have genetic disorders that shorten their lives.

The veto power of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council should be taken away or reformed. This unique right -- held only by China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States -- has historically limited the ability of the United Nations to intervene in dire situations, especially when two of the five nations are at odds with each other politically. Cold War politics between the United States and the former Soviet Union did not allow the United Nations to fulfill its intended functions as a collective security organization. As a result, the United Nations was stalemated and took no action during crucial moments, such as the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. If veto rights are not, at the very least, reformed, the United Nations risks being completely ineffectual in preventing conflict.

One of the most famous belays in mountaineering history was performed by Pete Schoening during the 1953 American expedition to summit the world's second highest mountain, K2. After establishing their eighth camp at nearly 7,700 meters, one of the eight expedition members developed blood clots in his leg and could not get back down the mountain unaided. Endangering their own lives but unwilling to leave their friend to die, the team wrapped him up in his sleeping bag and moved him down the mountain. Arriving at a very dangerous and steep ice field, Schoening jammed his ice pick behind a rock, tying the belay rope around his waist. When one of the other climbers slipped, creating a domino effect that sent six members of the team careening toward a cliff and certain death, Schoening had enough time to cling to his ice axe and belay his companions' descent. Though he is known for other amazing feats, his nickname became Pete ""The Belay"" Schoening.

It also requires credit card companies to provide ""plain sight/plain language"" disclosures to consumers, along with updates on how long it would take to pay off remaining balances and total interest costs if the consumer opts to pay only the minimum amount due every month. For consumers accustomed to paying only the minimum payment, this constitutes valuable information; many consumers have not been aware of how much of their monthly payment is applied toward their balance.

Olive trees must be roughly five years old before they are capable of producing fruit, depending on the variety (some require more time, but few require less). Olive harvesting typically occurs in September and October. Though hand picking is preferred, it is not always possible. Harvesting by machine is far less delicate and results in approximately 20% of the product being lost to damage. Hand removal takes more time but damage loss is typically around 5%. Once taken from the trees, the olives are ground into a paste, which helps release the oil. The paste is then either pressed, or put into a centrifuge to separate the oil from the water and solid material. After any remaining water and sediment is removed, the oil is bottled. It takes approximately 75 to 125 pounds of olives to produce just one gallon of olive oil. So, as you're drizzling some delicious and healthful olive oil onto your salad, remember what it took to get it there!

At about six feet in height, kangaroos have disproportionately large feet and tails that allow them to balance while jumping -- sometimes up to 25 feet in a single bound. Like their fellow marsupials, the wallaby and the koala, kangaroos are shy but friendly herbivores. Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of the kangaroo, however, is the pouch found on the abdomen of female kangaroos. Known as the marsupium, this pouch is common to all marsupials, but is most developed in kangaroos where it forms a small pocket. In other marsupials, the marsupium is simply a fold of skin. Baby kangaroos -- called joeys -- are about the size of a grape at birth, and are kept within the marsupium for both protection and for nursing. Fascinating creatures, kangaroos are often seen in the wilds of Australia.

In a short time finding the task which I had undertaken impracticable, as the birds poured in in countless multitudes, I rose, and counting the dots then put down, found that 163 had been made in twenty-one minutes. I travelled on, and still met more the farther I proceeded.

The term for words formed by blending is portmanteau; it was coined by the English writer Lewis Carroll in his well-known children's story, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, published in 1871. Carroll selected the word portmanteau, which is a suitcase with two compartments, because it perfectly represented the idea of what he wrote as, ""two meanings packed up into one word."" In his story, Carroll invents the word slithy as a portmanteau of slimy and lithe. Today, we have many portmanteau words, such as infomercial (for information and commercial), motel (for motor and hotel), rollicking (for rolling and frolicking), and hundreds more.

Ted and Hubert were proud of the commission and felt that much depended on them. Ted led the way, not merely because he was past fourteen and more than half a year older than his cousin, but because Hubert unconsciously yielded to the captaincy of a more venturesome and resolute spirit. Everything was ready for Christmas at home -- mince pies, fruit cake, a fat turkey hanging out in the cold -- and no doubt the as yet mysteriously reserved presents would be plentiful and satisfactory. Only a tree was still needed, and Ted and Hubert were to get it. So now, in the early afternoon of December 24, 1917, they tramped up the long hill at the back of the Ridgway farm toward North Carolina woods of evergreens and leafless maples.…Ted dragged a sled with rope wherewith to strap the tree thereon. Hubert trudged beside him -- always a little behind -- carrying a heavy sharp hatchet.
 
Based on the passage, one of the reasons Ted led the expedition to find a Christmas tree was because

A.	he was bold and more mature.
B.	he knew how to secure the tree.
C.	Hubert was armed with the hatchet.
D.	Hubert was too much of a risk-taker.

Its fragrant flowers attract bees, producing a thick, light brown honey. The fruit of the tree is sweet and edible. Seeds from the tree, called shea nuts, are used for making shea butter, which is used in traditional medicine to treat skin ailments of both people and animals. Shea butter can also be used as a substitute for cocoa butter. Oil extracted from these nuts is used as a cooking oil. The tree's hard, dense wood also provides a suitable material for making such useful things as boxes and charcoal. Given its many values, the shea tree and its products are in high demand in both the local and international markets.

According to the passage, which of following is true of the shea tree?

A.	Its seeds can be eaten as snacks.
B.	Its flowers are used for making perfume.
C.	Its extracted nut oil can be used for cooking.
D.	Its wood is easily carved into decorative objects.

This work is now seen as one of the finest examples of an emerging literary form called New Journalism -- the mingling of journalistic reporting of facts with imaginative writing, resulting in a novel that is a hybrid of both styles. To enable himself to recreate the events of a crime as realistically as possible, Capote spent six years conducting extensive research. He interviewed countless people, including prisoners on death row, and took enough notes for a two thousand page book. The creative aspect of his work is revealed in the details he selected to use, as well as those he decided to leave out. When the book was published, it was hailed as a great literary success, and was a financial success for Capote.

Which of the following statements about Capote is suggested by the passage?

A.	He succeeded because of his experience as a journalist.
B.	He hoped that New Journalism would make him rich.
C.	He was a leading figure in an emerging literary form.
D	He relied more on his imagination than on research.

No one will deny that a light heart has much to do with the pleasure of travel, and the man who can be serene under all circumstances, who laughs at mishaps, and accepts every situation with a smile of content, or at least with a feeling of resignation, is the model voyager. For him the miles go by as on the wings of a bird, while to the grumbler and misanthrope they are weighted with lead. The former comes back from his wanderings refreshed and instructed while the latter is no better in mind and body than when setting out on his journey.

In little more than a year, death has removed the two most prominent ﬁgures in the musical world of Russia. In October 1893, Tschaikowsky conducted the ﬁrst performance in St. Petersburg of his symphony in B minor, op. 74, to which he gave the predictive title of ""Symphonic Pathetique."" When three weeks later the work was repeated by the Imperial Musical Society, the occasion was an ""In Memoriam"" concert, given in honor of the composer himself; in the short interval, Tschaikowsky had fallen a victim to the cholera. On November 20th, 1894, his more renowned fellow-countryman, Anton Rubinstein, passed suddenly from among us. These two musicians, the former for many years director of the Conservatoire at Moscow, the latter, the founder and head of the sister institution in St. Petersburg, had exercised for a considerable period an almost autocratic inﬂuence over the musical life of Russia.

Indeed, throughout this period I saw only the somber side of his character -- the one side that showed itself in domestic life, for which he was not fitted. Later, when I was old enough to go out with him, I was surprised and charmed to find in him a person perfectly new to me. It seemed as if, in our old family house, he felt himself constrained by some fatal spell; once beyond its doors, his forehead cleared, his chest expanded, and he was young again.

It is not always from the closest and most accurate historian that we receive the truest picture of an age or of a character. The artist gives a more real picture than the photographer; and it needs imagination and sympathy, as well as labor and research, to make a hero of old time live again today. The minutest investigation will hardly better the vivid reality of Scott's James I or Charles II, or portray more truly than Mr. Shorthouse has done the fragile yet fascinating personality of Charles I. Yet to say this is not to undervalue history or … the labor of true students. Rather, without their aid we cannot rightly see the past at all: it comes to us only with the distortions of our own prejudice and our narrow modern outlook. We need both the work of the scholar and the imagination of the artist. Without the first we could not behold the past, without the second we could not understand it.

But I suppose it was something very serious, for the doctor said that I ought to have come to him a month before, and that if it (whatever it was) had gone on for another week he would not have answered for the consequences. It is an extraordinary thing, but I never knew a doctor called into any case yet but what it transpired that another day's delay would have rendered cure hopeless.

The human body is designed to have three defined curves along the spine, located in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions respectively. Common malformations of these areas include scoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis. Bad posture can lead to muscle fatigue and weakness. In addition, muscles that are placed under prolonged stress are more prone to injury. Joints in particular suffer greatly from misalignment, forming abnormal wear patterns that eventually develop into arthritis. Common contributors to poor posture include shoes with high heels, stress, and excess weight. Fortunately, there are methods for improving one's posture. By placing your weight primarily on the balls of the feet and pulling back the shoulders, alignment can be improved. While sitting, legs should remain parallel to the body, and the arms should be allowed to rest loosely. These are just a few of the ways posture can be improved.

According to the passage, which of the following can form from an abnormal wear pattern?

A.	arthritis

Poms are capital little companions, faithful, exceedingly sharp and intelligent, and generally devoted to one person; they are good with children if brought up with them; but they are fussy and excitable little things, bark a great deal, and have nerves. I do not consider the character some people give them of snappishness at all justified by facts; but here and there a sharp-tempered Pom may be found. Their quality of disdain towards strangers is one which ought to be considered a virtue in all pet dogs. They are not of the easiest dogs to train to the house, especially when kept in numbers, and are not always reliable in this way, mainly on account of their quick, nervous disposition; but for cleverness, affection, and beauty, they have few, if any, equals among toy dogs, and they are never likely to lose their popularity; a really good toy Pom is always immensely admired and courted wherever it is taken.

It may seem obvious what to look at -- i.e., whatever is within the frame or gathered in the box or sculpted on the pedestal. But to do the art justice, we need to linger a little longer and be aware of how the art is very subtly shifting and focusing our gaze and, in turn, our emotional or intellectual response. One way to appreciate this is to recognize that though the work of art -- a photograph, for example -- looks unmoving, it is figuratively full of movement. It is dynamic rather than static. Lines, shapes, tone, color -- all of these formal elements make the photograph vital and force spectators into a very active experience. We need to follow lines, linger over shapes or areas of light and dark, respond to a splatter of surprising color.

In the passage, which of the following is used as an example to demonstrate dynamic versus static expression in art?

In the United States, the credit reporting industry consists primarily of three national credit reporting agencies that maintain a wide range of information on approximately 200 million consumers. Creditors and others voluntarily submit information to these centralized, nationwide repositories of information. This information is then consolidated into consumer reports and credit reports. Users of credit reports analyze the data and other information to assess the risk posed by credit applicants, often using sophisticated predictive models to develop credit scores. This flow of information enables credit grantors and others to make fast and generally reliable decisions about a consumer's eligibility for various products and services, allowing consumers to obtain credit within minutes of applying.

In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.

The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase -- a restatement of the question in other words. What causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand. If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning, then having subjected to criticism the explanation of ""power"" that juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his reflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon.

They begin with what is called exposition, whereby the story teller introduces us to the characters, settings, and themes. Then, the characters interact and complications ensue; this is called rising action. The rising action is followed by an inciting incident, or turning point, where all is altered for the characters. This occurrence is considered to be the story's focal point. After this point, things continue to unfold and alter the characters during the falling action of the story.

First, ask yourself what specific claim the study is making. Does it sound unreasonable? Does it corroborate existing theories? Also, does the study acknowledge that additional research may be necessary? Understanding exactly what the scientific claim is can help you discern whether it is valid. Another chief concern with understanding a study's claims is the confusion between causation and correlation. Causation means one thing causes another; correlation, on the other hand, means only that a relationship exists between two things that could be due to chance or some specific variable or variables. Be wary of any claims that suggest correlation proves causation. Other validity questions to ask include, what is the evidence and exactly how did the researchers obtain it? By asking these questions and more, the reliability of research studies can become clearer.

An engine or propeller is necessary to create thrust, and drag is the result of friction and differences in air pressure. Each of these forces has an opposite force that acts against it. Lift and weight are opposites, as are drag and thrust. When an airplane is flying straight, level, and at a constant speed, all four forces are balanced. For a plane to go up, lift and thrust must be more than weight and drag. For it to go down, weight and drag have to be greater than lift and thrust. Understanding these four forces and how they enable planes to fly usually increases an air traveler's appreciation for the science of flight, especially at takeoff.

They're either harvested early, before they reach full size, or they are hybridized to create miniature versions. Cherry tomatoes, for example, have been developed genetically. Baby corn is simply corn picked before it's fully grown. One common exception to this, though, is baby-cut carrots, which actually are full grown carrots cut to smaller sizes. Even so, you can still buy real baby carrots in some stores.

Cai started by researching general tips from experts on the best ways to accomplish goals. She read that she should be very specific in her goals. For example, instead of telling herself vaguely that she wanted to learn French, she set a goal -- by the end of February she was determined to be able to go into a restaurant and order lunch entirely in French. It worked, because she knew exactly what to focus on and gave herself a deadline. The other advice she read was that accomplishing her goal -- in this case the acquisition of a language -- didn't have to be perfect. By giving herself credit for trying, she was less discouraged and was gradually able to improve.

If the instrument is used for playing classical music, it's a violin. If it's used for playing non-classical music -- such as bluegrass or Celtic -- some say it's a fiddle. Yet there does exist a subtle physical variation that sometimes makes the difference, and that variation is in the instrument's bridge. To make it easier to play on two strings at the same time, fiddle players sometimes use a flatter, less curved bridge on their instruments.

The prairie wolves roam over the plains in considerable numbers, and during the night, the principal season of their hunts, they venture very near to the encampment of the traveler. They are by far the most numerous of our wolves, and often unite in packs for the purpose of chasing deer, which they very frequently succeed in running down, and killing. This, however, is an achievement attended with much difficulty to them, and in which the exertion of their utmost swiftness and cunning are so often unavailing, that they are sometimes reduced to the necessity of eating wild plums, and other fruits, to them almost indigestible, in order to distend the stomach, and appease, in a degree, the cravings of hunger.

In the poster, Uncle Sam is pointing directly at the viewer, his stern glare presented above the caption: ""I WANT YOU FOR U.S. ARMY."" His gray hair peaks out from beneath his stovepipe top hat adorned with white stars on a blue band around its base. The character was created in 1916 by James Montgomery Flagg, who based the portrait on his own likeness. A vocal supporter of the war effort during World War I, Flagg went on to create 46 artworks dedicated to the promotion of military recruitment. None of Flagg's images, however, remained as famous as his depiction of Uncle Sam. Its enduring popularity led to the character being used again during World War II. Uncle Sam is still recognized today as a national icon.

It was founded in the 1570s by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the Spanish explorer who, after establishing Spanish dominion over the Philippines, served as the colony's first governor. The Spanish term for ""within walls,"" Intramuros is surrounded by 20-foot-thick walls, and served as the central location of the Spanish government there. Its central plaza contained the Spanish city hall and, most noticeably, the San Agustin Church, which still stands today and serves as the final resting place of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. During World War II, while occupied by Japanese forces, Intramuros was reduced to rubble following battles involving American and Philippine forces.

In this poetic narrative, Chaucer creates and brings to life a range of memorable human characters -- some noble, some romantic, some comedic, and some rather dark -- as they travel together from London on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. To entertain one another along the way, the characters tell stories, and it is in these stories that Chaucer reveals his mastery of the English language, now widely considered second only to that of William Shakespeare. Living at a time when French was the official language of the court, Chaucer's decision to write in English is now viewed as a major contribution to the literary advancement and use of English. Born to a prosperous family in London, England, in the 1340s, Chaucer served three English kings as a diplomat, customs controller, and supervisor of royal residences.

Even without the famous dictionary for which he is primarily remembered, Webster would still be an important figure in American history whose intense patriotism influenced the likes of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. His accomplishments were many. For example, in 1793, he founded American Minerva, the first daily newspaper in New York City. He was also a contributor to the establishment of Amherst College in Massachusetts. Additionally, Webster's tireless efforts to protect his intellectual property -- his American Spelling Book outsold every other book in 19th century America except the Bible -- led to the development of American copyright laws.

Henry is concerned that if the enemy charges, he might flee. When the enemy charges, however, Henry stays and helps defeat them. After a brief nap, Henry finds the enemy is charging again. This time, he flees. Feeling guilty, Henry wanders the woods, watching the battle from a distance. But a group of fleeing Union soldiers crosses paths with him, one of whom, in frantic retreat, hits Henry in the head with a rifle. After reuniting with his regiment, Henry finds they believe he was struck with a bullet during the fighting. Fueled partly by guilt, Henry fights harder than he ever thought he could.

After being caught, Chapman was incarcerated on the island of Jersey, near the coast of France. In 1940, when the Germans invaded Jersey, Chapman -- using his ability to deceive -- convinced the Germans that he hated the British government and wanted to work as a German spy. After a year of espionage training with the Germans, Chapman was parachuted back into his homeland. Upon landing, however, he turned himself in, convincing the British Security Service that he was loyal to Britain, not Germany, and thus became a double agent -- ""Agent Zigzag"" -- one of the most remarkable agents in history. While gaining valuable intelligence for Britain, he fed false information to Germany, which led the Germans to redirect their bombs away from London. After the war, the British government absolved Chapman of all his past crimes.

Here the boy found that noises would burst from him in the most unexpected and involuntary manner, noises that the long rooms and passageways seemed to take up and echo and magnify a hundred times. Mrs. Brown was constantly urging him ""not to disturb poor Mr. Peyton,"" and Hotchkiss, the butler, who went about with silent footsteps, always looked pained when Oliver slammed a door or made a clatter on the stairs.

On the dark end of the chocolate spectrum are the unsweetened, bittersweet, semisweet, and sweet varieties, which are often used in baking. It is no surprise that the unsweetened variety contains no added sugar and is 100% cocoa, making it bitter unless added to other ingredients. Bittersweet and semisweet, on the other hand, contain some sugar, cocoa butter, and approximately 40-80% cocoa, making them more desirable as a standalone treat. On the other end of the chocolate spectrum are milk chocolates. These varieties contain higher amounts of cocoa butter, more than 12% milk, and around 10-20% cocoa. Its milder, sweet flavor and smooth texture make milk chocolate less desirable for baking but more beloved as an individual confection. White chocolate, though often associated with the other types, is not strictly chocolate. Instead, white chocolate contains mostly cocoa butter, sugar, and milk. Finally, chocolate can also be distinguished by its state. Found in solid, liquid, and powdered forms, its uses are endless.

For example, Paul Revere, who was immortalized in Longfellow's poem ""Paul Revere's Ride,"" was not a lone horseman who delivered the midnight message ""the British are coming."" In reality, he was with two others, who alerted several others. Before the end of the night, more than 40 people on horseback were delivering the message. Likewise, Patrick Henry is famed for his impassioned, ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" speech of March 23, 1775 before the Second Virginia Convention. A printed record of that speech, however, was not published until about 42 years after the event.

Eventually, Basquiat began to prefer the gallery over the streets, although some of his work during this early phase retained his graffiti style. As he matured, Basquiat began investigating different techniques and styles of collage and montage, incorporating imagery from his familial heritage.

Invented by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830s and 1840s, Morse code depended upon the telegraph device for its transmission, which was also invented by Samuel Morse. The system was the earliest means of rapid, long-distance communication. The most famous ""word"" in Morse code is ""SOS,"" which was adopted by the International Radio Telegraphic Convention of 1906 as the standard signal for distress. Contrary to popular belief, the initials SOS do not mean ""save our ship,"" but were chosen as the distress signal because of their clear and distinct combination of dots and dashes; the letter ""s"" is represented by three dots, the letter ""o"" by three dashes. For this reason, it was believed that SOS was both easy to remember and easy to understand for anyone in distress.

Based on the passage, which of the following is true of the term ""SOS""?

A.	It means ""save our ship.""

Once hatched, the worms spend the better part of a month consuming large quantities of mulberry leaves to increase their body weight. When the worms stop eating, they are ready to begin forming their cocoons. Silk worms produce two strands of silk from glands in their mouths, as well as a sticky glue-like substance that bonds the two strands together into one. The worm takes one strand and wraps it repeatedly around its body in a figure eight pattern, until it is fully encased. By the end of this process, which takes around two days, the worm has wrapped itself in more than a mile of continuous silk thread. Despite its immense strength, a single strand of silk is not sufficient for textile production, so 3 to 10 strands are wound together to create a heavier weight thread. Amazingly, it takes approximately 3,000 cocoons to produce just one pound of silk.

As you approach the space, activate your right-turn signal. Then, line up your car, side by side, with the one parked directly in front of the empty space. Put your car in reverse, turn the steering wheel to the right, and begin backing into the space. Once the rear of your car is in the space, turn the steering wheel left, which will snake your car into the space while straightening it out.

The novel's very first sentence stops many readers cold: ""riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs."" Some have marveled at Joyce's ability to manipulate and transform words into a decidedly musical quality. Others dismiss his work as indecipherable rubbish. A few critics have even suggested that Finnegans Wake is a joke -- a deliberate hoax performed by Joyce to trick the world into believing that a series of long, nonsensical lines amounts to a literary masterpiece.

1147.	Contrary to popular belief, when Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon landed in Florida in 1513, he was not in search of the fabled Fountain of Youth. A wellspring of magical waters would certainly be a great discovery, especially if it had the power to grant everlasting life. But Ponce de Leon's goals were more realistic and somewhat more banal: to stake claims for the Spanish monarchy in order to gain political clout and favor. It remains a mystery how Ponce de Leon's name became connected with the Fountain of Youth, but some say that perhaps a few ill-intentioned revisionist historians propagated the tale as a way to paint Ponce de Leon as gullible and vain. The idea of such a fountain, however, has made for such a captivating legend that Ponce de Leon is now best remembered by many as a well-intentioned explorer on a difficult mission.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	The location of the Fountain of Youth is still unknown.

Considered by many to be one of the greatest Portuguese novelists in history, Jose Saramago was a surrealist and avant-gardist whose prose style was often characterized by long, run-on sentences. His style was further distinguished by its lack of basic conventional markers, such as quotation marks and paragraph breaks. In one of his most famous novels, Blindness, he completely abandons the use of names; the characters are referred to by some distinguishing characteristic, such as Girl with Dark Glasses, Man with Black Eye Patch, and the Boy with the Squint. In spite of these stylistic idiosyncrasies, Saramago's work continues to be popular, which many attribute to its allegorical nature. In Blindness, for instance, all the people in an unnamed city go blind, one by one. In The Stone Raft, Spain and Portugal break off from Europe and drift into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

In discussing Saramago, the author's primary focus is on

A.	the greatness of the work Blindness.

With impaired cognition, accidents can occur. For example, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), drowsy driving is the cause of about 100,000 automobile crashes every year, including about 71,000 injuries and 1,550 deaths. In fact, the NHTSA has found that being awake for 24 hours straight results in cognitive impairment similar to having a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent, which is higher than the legal limit in all states. Major incidents, such as nuclear facility accidents, oil spills and train crashes, have also been linked, in part, to sleep deprivation. If you're having a hard time sleeping at night, incorporate more exercise into your daily routine. Most adults should get between seven and eight hours of sleep per night.

Akin to martial arts, parkour challenges participants to move as efficiently from one place to another as possible, using only their bodies. There are no rules; movements are limited only by the imagination and creativity of its players, called traceurs. Obstacles such as walls or rocks become playthings; traceurs find ways to use their bodies to vault up and over walls and other impediments in the course. There are no teams or competitions in parkour, but its devotees often organize as a group to perform its activities. Although parkour has its origins in survival tactics taught by the French military during World Wars I and II, it didn't gain popular attention until the 1990s.

We came at last to the foot of an exceeding steep wood, which scrambled up a craggy hillside, and was crowned by a naked precipice. ""It's here,"" said one of the guides, and we struck up hill. The trees clung upon the slope, like sailors on the shrouds of a ship, and their trunks were like the rounds of a ladder, by which we mounted. Quite at the top, and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang above the foliage, we found that strange house which was known in the country as ""Cluny's Cage."" The trunks of several trees had been wattled across, the intervals strengthened with stakes, and the ground behind this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor. A tree, which grew out from the hillside, was the living center-beam of the roof. The walls were of wattle and covered with moss.

Called the candlefish, this delicious, slender little creature is about 12 inches long and is prized for its delicate flavor. But beyond its use as a food, the candlefish has another remarkable quality: when dried, it can be burned like a candle, and gives off a bright white flame -- hence, its name. In February, March, and April, when the candlefish are in their spring run, locals catch large quantities of them. Some are eaten fresh, others are preserved by salting or smoking. However, because their fat is so prized, many candlefish are pressed for their oil to be used in cooking -- much like whale's blubber was used in the past.

Except for a few old biographies now out of print, and occasional references to his gifts and charm in literary criticisms, his part in the growing-up of our country seemed slipping out of the consciousness of the young people of today. Yet because Louis Agassiz was wise enough and reckless enough with youth to discard dull bookish learning for original observation, he gave even the youngest learner a chance to share the high excitement and triumph of firsthand discovery.... ""Come with me,"" he said. ""I will show you how to find things out for yourself."" And like an immortal Pied Piper, youth has followed him ever since.

One of the most difficult things to prepare is a perfect mayonnaise, but once the knack is acquired, failure afterwards is rare. One essential point is to have all the materials cold. Chill in the refrigerator both the bowl and oil an hour or more before using. In warm weather it is advisable during the mixing to stand the bowl in a larger one of cracked ice. This dressing, if covered closely, will keep several days or longer in the icebox. Keep in a cold place till wanted, as it liquefies as soon as mixed with meat or vegetables. To tone down the taste of the oil, and thus make more delicate salads, one may add to the dressing, just before it is used, a little cream beaten stiff and dry. This dressing is used with nut and fruit salads, and may be used with potatoes, tomatoes, celery, and other vegetables.

What is less well known is why North America and South America have America rather than Columbus in their names. It turns out that one of Columbus' friends, Amerigo Vespucci, was also quite an active explorer. He made several voyages of his own. In a letter he wrote to friends in Italy, Vespucci asserted that these lands were entirely separate from Europe -- a revolutionary idea in those days. In describing what we now call South America, Vespucci called it Mundus Novus -- ""New World."" His letter circulated widely, and by 1507, a German cartographer published a little book called Introduction to Cosmology that included some of Vespucci's writings. The book cited only Vespucci's voyages -- not those of Columbus -- and proposed calling the new land America, in honor of Amerigo Vespucci. Owing to the book's popularity, the name America eventually stuck.

Homophones are words that sound the same, but have different spellings or meanings. In the case of ""I here you,"" the correct spelling for the word that sounds like ""here"" is ""hear."" Like the words hear and here, the words accept and except, and fare and fair are examples of homophones. Confusion over which word to use in a sentence occurs frequently. One of the most common homophone errors occurs with the words to and too. When these words are spelled correctly but used incorrectly, they result in errors that aren't caught by computer spell checkers. A way to use to and too correctly is remember that too means ""also"" or ""excessively."" Think of the additional ""o"" as indicating something extra. When using a homophone, it's always worth a second look, to make sure it's spelled correctly.

In what is known as the lost-wax process, artists first create a clay sculpture, which serves as the original design. This clay original is coated in three coats of either polyurethane or silicon rubber, forming a mold. The mold is then coated in plaster and, once dried, separated from the clay original and filled with several layers of liquid wax. Once a wax replica has been made, it is separated from the mold and refined through a smoothing process known as wax-chasing. Then wax rods are added to the sculpture to act as channels for the molten bronze. Next, the wax sculpture is dipped several times into liquid ceramic and then fired in an oven, called an autoclave. The wax within melts out of the form, leaving a negative impression of the sculpture. Fired again, the negative is then filled with liquid bronze and left to cool for several hours. Once cooled, the ceramic outside is chipped away, revealing the bronze sculpture.

Which of the following statements about the lost-wax method is suggested by the passage?

Toothed whales, as the name suggests, have enamel-covered teeth used for capturing prey. These whales find, chase, and capture their prey -- fish, squid, crabs, starfish, and other ocean creatures -- but surprisingly, they can swallow their prey whole! Baleen whales, sometimes called ""mustache whales,"" are toothless. These whales have bristle-like fringes that hang in sheets from their upper jaw. They feed by ingesting large amounts of water containing plankton and small marine life, through their mouths. They then strain food from the water by expelling the water through the baleen.

Raw natural rubber, obtained from the sap of certain species of tropical trees, gained popularity in the United States and Great Britain at the start of the 19th century for its use in clothing, luggage, and safety equipment. However, raw rubber had its problems -- it nearly melted in the summer, and became brittle and rigid in the winter. Charles Goodyear, an American inventor who is most famous for developing vulcanized rubber, noticed that the rubber industry was struggling and saw a business opportunity. For years, Goodyear experimented with different rubber manufacturing methods with little success. Throughout his early experimentation, his family lived in poverty and he was even jailed for debts to his investors. He persisted though and finally discovered that rubber, combined with sulfur and lead and heated at a low temperature produced a stable product that performed well at all temperatures. Goodyear won a patent for his ""vulcanized rubber"" in 1844, and his invention is now part of a billion-dollar industry that includes tires, roads, and construction materials.

It is the only U.S. volcano in the Cascade Range that has been affected by both alpine and continental glaciation. This stratovolcano is composed mainly of andesite lava flows and breccias and was largely formed prior to the most recent major glaciation (Fraser Glaciation), which occurred between about 25,000 and 10,000 years ago. The most recent major eruption at Mount Baker, about 6,700 years ago, was accompanied by a major flank-collapse event that caused lahars to rush down the Nooksack River and then eastward into Baker Lake. In 1975-76, Sherman Crater, immediately south of the summit, exhibited signs of renewed volcanic activity as a result of magma intruding into the volcano but not erupting. This activity resulted in monitoring that was more intense than previously applied at any other Cascade Range volcano and produced important baseline data against which recent research has been compared.

Based on the passage, which of the following produced important baseline data?

A.	glaciation in the Cascade Range
B.	a major eruption at Mount Baker
C.	lahars rushing down the Nooksack River
D.	renewed volcanic activity at Sherman Crater

Monitoring and research at their volcano observatories helps advance the understanding of active volcanism and allows the Volcano Hazards Program to provide warnings of impending eruptions in the United States. The USGS monitors earthquake activity, ground deformation, gas chemistry, and other geophysical and hydrologic conditions before, during, and after eruptions. Observations are used to detect activity leading to an eruption, provide emergency information about future and ongoing eruptions, identify hazardous areas around active and potentially active volcanoes, and improve understanding of how volcanoes erupt and change the environment. In addition to the Volcano Hazards Program, the USGS also runs the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program that assists other nations in their preparation for and response to volcano emergencies.

According to the passage, which of the following issues warnings of impending eruptions in the United States?

A.	USGS observatories

It is one of the best known of the twenty-seven amendments, perhaps because it is one which applies to every citizen on a daily basis. While a number of constitutional amendments are important to the functioning of the government -- such as the 25th amendment, which regulates the order of succession in the executive branch -- and others delineate states' rights, the freedoms of expression outlined in the First Amendment are rights that each of us practices over the course of our lifetimes -- every week and every day. We exercise the rights guaranteed in this amendment every time we voice a political opinion, read a newspaper, or attend religious services.

Nearly a mile deep, Lake Baikal holds over 23,000 cubic kilometers of water. Lakes formed by the erosive force of ancient glaciers, such as the Great Lakes, can be thousands of feet deep. Conversely, some very large lakes may be only a few dozen feet deep -- Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana, for example, has a maximum depth of only about 15 feet. As for what lives in lakes, most support a host of aquatic life. Lakes where water cannot escape via a river are saline lakes and are too salty for most aquatic life. The Dead Sea in the Middle East isn't called ""Dead"" for nothing! Some saline lakes were formed in ancient times when they were connected to seas and when rainfall may have been heavier. These lakes have been shrinking since the last ice age. The ancient Lake Bonneville in the United States was once as big as Lake Michigan, and the Great Salt Lake was once about 14 times larger than it is now.

At last the day had come, and the children were to leave Camp-in-the-Clouds. They had been there for one whole glorious week of fishing, hunting, camping, picnicing, stories, and sleeping in tents. Betty and Jimmie felt rather sober, for the time for them to go back to the city was drawing near. A week now, and their good times for the summer would be over. Already the leaves were turning a little, and the air growing crisper every day.… Betty and Jimmie liked their city home, and after they were once in it they enjoyed their school work, too. They had many friends, entertainments, parties, and made many expeditions to the Zoo and to the parks. But, somehow, the happiest days of all the year came in the summer in Rangeley Village.

Learning of the starvation faced by the people of Belgium during World War I due to military blockades, Hoover could not stand idly by. Hoover stepped forward to organize and direct the Commission for Relief of Belgium, a non-political agency that helped feed millions of people in Belgium and northern France for almost four and a half years. It was a mission that defined Herbert Hoover around the world as a man of moral courage, initiative, and compassion. By 1935, he was a staunch supporter of the Boys' Clubs of America, which became the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in 1990. UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, created in 1946, owes its existence, in part, to Hoover, who continued to be an advocate for children around the world long after his presidency ended in 1933.

Lanternfish have many light-producing organs, called photophores, arranged in rows along the lengths of their bodies. Researchers aren't certain whether the luminous pale spots are used primarily to find food in the darkness of the ocean, to frighten away predators, or to signal other fish for mating. Although most lanternfish prefer to stay close to the coastline, they can be found in large schools at various depths throughout the world's oceans. Living at depths from 200 to 1,000 meters during the day to avoid predators in shallower waters, schools of lanternfish swim to the surface each night to feed upon plankton. For those who are in a position to observe these nightly activities, the sight of thousands of lanternfish feeding in the surface waters must be impressive.

Cheddar cheese originated in the English town of Cheddar, where it has been manufactured since the 1500s. Originally, cheddar had a naturally yellow color due to the beta carotenes found in the grasses that the cows ate. As farming practices changed and cows were provided foodstuffs based more on grains than grasses, cheddar became paler. Those who purchased it perceived pale cheddar as being somewhat inferior to deeper-colored cheddar; consequently, cheese makers began adding a yellow dye called annatto. Eventually, popular demand was for cheddar with so much dye that it appeared orange, as we often see it today. The only difference between pale cheddar and so-called yellow cheddar is the dye. Both colors of cheese taste the same.

Based on the passage, after farming practices changed, cheddar cheese

The Ukrainian folk tradition of creating intricately decorated eggs is called pysanky. Since ancient times, such eggs were used in celebrating the coming of spring, and the word pysanky derives from the Ukrainian verb meaning ""to write."" Pysanka, as the eggs themselves are called, are elaborate creations using wax and different colored dyes. The first step is to blow the whites and yolks out of the eggs. Then, using a special tool called a kitska, wax is applied to the shell to create the design; dye is not absorbed into the shell where the wax has been applied. Eggs are dyed using the lightest colored dye first, and subsequent applications of wax define where the chosen colors of dye will and won't absorb. After the last color has been applied, all of the wax is melted off the egg, revealing a beautiful work of art.

According to the passage, the first step in creating a pysanky egg is to

A.	color it with dye.

He worked briefly with Thomas Edison before pursuing a number of his own inventions. One example of Tesla's genius was a wireless, remote-controlled toy robotic boat, which became a front-page news story in 1898. He tried to offer his invention to the U.S. government, but his idea was rejected. It was not until the Chief Examiner of the U.S. Patent Office personally viewed the remote-controlled boat that Tesla was granted a patent. Over the course of his life, Tesla was awarded more than one hundred patents, including one for radio, the Tesla coil, remote controls, and most noteworthy, the alternating current (AC) power system that is widely used today.

Over time, breeders developed a dog with a high strength-to-size ratio and quick muscle movement. Genetics are not, however, the only factor involved in a quality sled dog. Temperament plays an important role. Quality sled dogs possess a desire to run without regard to being strapped with a significant amount of weight. As pups, the dogs are socialized to be comfortable around people and other dogs and are taught basic commands. At around six months old, they are fitted with a harness but are not attached to a sled. They run alongside already established teams to observe and learn. While still young, the dogs are inserted into a veteran team, where they gather valuable training on short excursions at first, and then progress to greater and greater distances. A great deal of time and effort are invested in a single dog, but the investment is worth it as many dogs still pull sleds even up to 10 years of age.

Which of the following statements about sled dogs is suggested by the passage?

A.	They will eventually retire from sledding.

The rhinoceros beetle is one of these surprisingly talented creatures. The bodybuilder of the insect world, it can lift an object that weighs 850 times its own body weight. That would be like a 200-pound person lifting 85 tons. It's hard to imagine such strength coming from a creature barely six inches long. Ants are also heavy-lifters, capable of carrying up to 50 times their body weight. But not all strength in the insect world is just lifting power. The titan beetle's power is in its jaws. It can easily snap a pencil in half. And, in the world of jumping great distances, the flea reigns supreme. It can jump 8 inches. That may not sound impressive, but that's 150 times its height. Could you jump over 800 feet?

Having studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and then at the Art Students League in New York as an adolescent, she was unfulfilled with her work, which focused on imitative realism, and decided to abandon the fine arts. In the summer of 1915, at the age of 28, she rekindled her interests and took painting classes at the Teachers College of Columbia University, South Carolina, where she was introduced to the ideas of Arthur Wesley Dow. These ideas helped O'Keeffe depart from her traditional style of art to explore a style that was her own -- she created charcoal drawings. Shortly thereafter, her work caught the attention of Alfred Stieglitz, a renowned photographer and art promoter, who encouraged her to pursue painting full time. O'Keeffe's art finally achieved recognition and by the mid-1920s, she had become one of America's most successful artists. She is still recognized as a major figure in American art today.

Considered one of the smartest birds in the world, crows have proven capable of understanding cause and effect, and can solve complex problems through the use of tools. For example, a crow was given the challenge of retrieving a piece of food floating out of its reach inside a narrow glass column of water. The crow used stones and other objects to displace the liquid, raising the water level, and making the food accessible. Intelligence is also demonstrated in their communication. Scientists have discovered that the crow's different ""caws"" act as a language, conveying happiness, anger, danger, and even antagonism. Crows also post guards, known as ""sentries,"" during eating times, to warn the group of an approaching predator. Young birds are often found playing with objects out of pure curiosity and amusement, which is also considered a sign of intelligence.

This event, along with his resulting feelings of isolation and loneliness, is said to have initiated his blue period, so named for his almost exclusive use of sober shades of blue and blue-green. Picasso's monochromatic blue period gave way to his rose period in 1904 when his color palette changed to warmer, brighter colors, including pinks and reds. Consequently, the mood of his paintings during this period became slightly more optimistic. Picasso's artistic expression continued to evolve into other styles, such as Cubism, Neoclassicism, Surrealism, and Expressionism.

According to the passage, Picasso's blue period produced works that were

A.	uplifting.

In that sense, calling a mushroom a fungus is like calling an apple a tree. The rest of the organism is not visible unless you dig down a few inches under the topsoil. There you might see a network of tiny cobweb-like fibers organized into a mat called a mycelium that runs through the moist soil, sometimes for acres. The mycelium can form a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with other plants and trees in the forest by interacting with their roots. The mycelium can serve as an extension of the plants' root systems and allows the plants to take up more water and nutrients; in return, the fungus obtains sugars from the plants. In the average forest, over ninety percent of the native plant species are interconnected through these fungal networks.

In the passage, the author compares the above-ground part of a fungus to

A.	an apple.

Some writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only different, but have different origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our affections, the latter negatively by restraining our vices…. Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer.

According to the author, even under the best circumstances, government is

He worked in the family business using his chemistry background and, in 1863, Nobel developed an explosive using nitroglycerine. Resulting explosions, including one in which his brother and several other people were killed, convinced Nobel to invent something safer. In 1867, he patented a more stable nitroglycerine derivative called dynamite. He also developed the blasting cap, which could light the dynamite by fuse. These and other inventions of the time made mining and construction work much more efficient. Though he was one of the most successful chemists, inventors, and industrialists of his time, he was also a peace advocate and wrote poetry. Afraid that he would be only remembered for the creation of something destructive, Nobel, in his will, set aside part of his wealth to create a prize for persons or organizations whose work promotes peace. Today, the Nobel prizes continue to award those who demonstrate innovation in the areas of science, literature, and world peace.

Based on the passage, Nobel created dynamite because he

A.	wanted to make a more stable explosive.

I'm a bashful individual, though I can't get any one to believe it; so it cost me a great effort to poke about the Worcester depot till the right door appeared, then walk into a room containing several gentlemen, and blunder out my request in a high state of stammer and blush. Nothing could have been more courteous than this dreaded President, but it was evident that I had made as absurd a demand as if I had asked for the nose off his respectable face.

Much was I disappointed upon learning the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday. As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling, and though poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original -- the Tyre of this Carthage.

There, grains of sand are swept up the beach by the sea breeze, and if you put something in their path -- say, a stick of driftwood -- the grains are carried over it, hit the dead air behind the obstacle, lose momentum, and drop. Soon you have a small mound of sand piling up behind the object, but the process doesn't stop there. Your new dune continues to grow, becoming an obstacle itself. The wind continues to move sand up the face of the dune, over its crest, and then the sand slides down the back side and settles. The dune slowly continues to march until, perhaps, a few plants begin to take root and hold the sand in place.

According to the passage, immediately after the driftwood is placed in the path of the blowing sand, the grains

Before planting, farmers must make sure that the soil has warmed to at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit. It is also critical to choose a site with full sunlight. Pumpkin seeds should be planted between 2.5 and 3.75 centimeters deep. Depending on the size of the expected pumpkins, rows should be spaced at least six feet apart. After the seeds are planted, it is important to practice shallow cultivation when weeding (do not dig too deeply into the soil) because some of the roots grow close to the surface. Finally, it is essential to have enough bees or other insects in the area to pollinate the crop. It is crucial to note that pesticides can harm pollinators, so farmers should take this into consideration when dealing with pests. With careful attention, each plant will yield several pumpkins worthy of the holiday table.

We scarcely knew whether to haunt it in spectral fascination, or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity. For one thing, the bad odor of the house was strongest there; and for another thing, we did not like the white fungus growths which occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth floor. … They rotted quickly, and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent; so that nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke of witch-fires glowing behind the broken panes of the fetor-spreading windows.

An idiom is an expression whose meaning cannot be understood simply by knowing the meaning of each of its individual elements. For example, if you say ""it's raining cats and dogs"" you don't mean there are cats and dogs literally falling from the sky. You mean it's raining hard with a lot of volume. Another example of an idiom is saying you have to learn something ""by heart."" This phrase has no bearing on the actual function of your heart. It simply means to commit something to memory. Sometimes the origins of these idioms are known and sometimes they are so old that there is not enough historical documentation to be sure where they came from. Most languages employ idioms, so when learning a new language it's important to remember the use of direct translations of your own English idioms may not translate to the language you learn. For example, ""it's raining cats and dogs"" in Denmark won't make sense, but ""it's raining shoemaker's apprentices"" will.

Fortunately, I've found ways to coax creative thoughts out of my head on those days when I'm having a difficult time. One thing I've found helpful is going for a walk. I don't know if it's breathing in the fresh air, the physical activity, or some other reason, but a nice, long walk almost always helps. If walking doesn't work, I meditate. I have several audio recordings of meditation exercises that help quiet my mind. Listening to one of them usually restores my creativity. If walking and meditation don't work, I turn to some other unrelated task. I may clean my house or run some errands and usually once I'm finished, I feel much more creative.

I'm consistently amazed at all of the things I can make in it. From pot roast to chicken chili to oatmeal to apple pie, my family has enjoyed many different slow cooker recipes. The greatest tip I have for anyone new to cooking with a slow cooker is to never, ever, ever remove the lid while cooking. I know it can be irresistible at times when smelling the fragrant aromas, but lifting the lid allows so much heat out that it extends cooking time. I've found for every time I remove it, I have had to add thirty minutes to my total cooking time. My best advice is to leave the cooker alone until it's done.

Mother Jones is essentially an individualist. Her own emotions and ideas are so strong that she is sometimes in conflict with others, fighting for the same cause. This too is an old story; the real leaders of any cause are necessarily individualists and are often impatient of others who likewise must go in their own way. All movements attract men and women of various minds. The early abolitionists could not agree as to methods. In their crusade were found the men who believed in constitutional methods, such as Giddings and Lincoln; the men who believed in force, of which John Brown was the chief; the non-resistant, like William Lloyd Garrison; the lone individualist who hit wherever he found a head to hit, like Wendell Phillips.

The fact that invention has not only been increasing during the past one hundred years, but that its speed of increase has been increasing and is still increasing, is well recognized. There seems to be a constant force behind invention that imparts to it an acceleration, comparable to that of gravity in accelerating the descent of a falling stone. Such a phenomenon would be thoroughly conformable to modern theories; and that there is a force, impelling people to invent, must be a fact; for otherwise, they would not invent. If that force be constant, the acceleration imparted to invention will be constant. If the force be variable, the acceleration imparted to invention will be variable. In other words, the future speed of invention, like that of every moving body, must be governed by the force behind it and the resistances opposed.

Which of the following best restates the author's main point?

A.	The force behind invention conveys its acceleration.

People are surprised to learn that these horses are not native to the area. According to l, they are descendants of horses carried on a Spanish galleon that sank in the 1600s. A less romantic, but more likely, possibility is that they are offspring of the animals brought here for tax-free grazing by early settlers. Regardless of their origin, these hardy horses are now uniquely adapted to the island; their pony-like short stature and large bellies are a result of a more than 300-year-old diet of nutrient-poor saltmarsh grasses and gallons and gallons of water.

These plants grow well together: cornstalks provide a natural trellis for the beans to climb, beans add nitrogen to the soil to nourish the corn, and squash cover the ground, keeping it moist and free from weeds. Grilled corn and squash, mixed with cooked beans and apple cider vinaigrette, make for an excellent autumn salad, among many other dishes. Consumed together, the three crops provide most of the essential nutrients; corn is rich in carbohydrates, beans contain protein, and squash add vitamins and healthy oils.

Two grand staircases flank the Great Hall, overseen by two shrouded figures bearing torches of knowledge, the exposed bulbs celebrating the invention of electricity. The figures are surrounded by an assembly of putti, children personifying the various occupations and pursuits of the brave new world: a musician, an electrician (with Bell's telephone), an astronomer, an entomologist, a physician -- a fascinating mash-up of classical form and modern attributes. The building was clearly meant to celebrate the young country's achievements in science, art, and literature and signal its position as a worthy and natural heir to the lasting triumphs of world civilizations.

The jewel referred to in the passage is a

A.	hall.

Fallingwater is his genius child, a home built around -- and over -- a waterfall. I expected Fallingwater to be damp, dark, and unwelcoming, more about looks than function. Instead, the house blended amicably with its surroundings, but it was inside where this came most into focus: stunning Picassos and Riveras framed perfectly in the fleeting light, the sound of water and the woods all around. As you float through the self-guided tour, the house, its windows, and its terraces open up just where you wish they would. I felt at ease there -- and, through the views all around me, connected to the landscape outside wherever I went. Everything, to the smallest detail, is carefully thought out, warm, and comforting. Outside, old, melancholy trees welcome you -- and, just as the tour ends, you wish you could go back again and spend a whole day inside, simply watching the light pass through this remarkable home.

Often called thousand-year-old-eggs, chicken or duck eggs are first coated with ash, lime, salt, and tea leaves. Then they are packed into large earthenware containers and buried in the ground for roughly 100 days. During that time, the coating penetrates the egg shell, creating a chemical reaction that causes fermentation and gelation inside the egg. When it is time to dig up the eggs, they are scraped clean of the coating mixture and shelled. The eggs then have transparent dark amber whites and grayish-green yolks. Sliced into wedges and served as an appetizer with pickled ginger, the eggs have a pleasantly sharp flavor and odor enjoyed by many people in Asian countries. Refrigerated, these eggs have a shelf life of several months.

According to the passage, a thousand-year-old egg is unique due to

Also called ""ice flowers"" and ""feather frost,"" these rare but natural ""blooms"" aren't really flowers, and they aren't made of frost. Rather, they are ice formations that resemble feathers or puffs of cotton. These amazing formations tend to occur during a hard freeze in the late fall and early winter. The water in the plant's stem is drawn upward by capillary action from the ground. It expands as it freezes, splits the stem vertically, and freezes on contact with the air. As more water is drawn from the ground through the split, it extrudes the paper thin ice layer further from the stem, forming delicate filaments of ice. Not all plants are capable of producing frost flowers, but among those that do, their icy blooms are a rare and amazing sight.

According to the passage, frost flowers occur naturally when

A.	an early freeze encases plants in ice.

When threatened, a hedgehog rolls itself up into a ball so that its short, pointy quills poke out in all directions, discouraging attackers. Hedgehogs like to eat insects, snails, snakes, and frogs. They also feed on roots, fruits, and fungi. In cold climates, hedgehogs may hibernate anywhere from as little as two weeks to six months, depending on the severity of the winter. Their habitats range from Great Britain to Africa; none are indigenous to the Americas. From fossil records we know that hedgehogs have been around since the age of the dinosaurs. So long as humans don't completely obliterate their habitats, hedgehogs may yet endure a little longer.

Next to some parsnips, he saw a vegetable with an odd appearance, looking like something from an alien planet. He picked it up for a closer look. About the size of a large pale green turnip, the thing had stubby stems with small leaves growing out the sides of its bulbous body. ""Might it be some new hybrid?"" he wondered, ""Perhaps a cross between a Brussels sprout and a rutabaga?"" A little sign said kohlrabi, something he wasn't sure he'd heard of. It might be entirely possible, Harold considered, that he might enjoy eating one. Maybe kohlrabi was a delicacy he'd been missing out on all his life.

While still quite young, Mary would sit silently on a little stool in the corner of her grandmother's front parlor, watching as the old woman guided young musicians through their violin lessons. Though the woman's gray hair and wrinkles marked her advancing age, her fingers could still glide along the strings, and with the bow in her other hand, she coaxed out haunting melodies. Some of the music had been composed even before Mary's grandmother and even her great grandmother had been born. Thousands of people all over the world had heard these tunes; perhaps people who were now long forgotten had danced to them. Mary tried to imagine such a scene.

Scientists believe that a number of factors are contributing to the population decrease, including parasites, loss of habitat, and the use of harmful pesticides and insecticides. For example, tracheal and varroa mites pose a significant threat to honeybees and have become more prominent in recent years. Invading the honeybee both inside and out, these parasites cripple hives and have proven resistant to some chemical cures, making them difficult to control. Loss of habitat also puts stress on honeybee populations. Wild lands are developed, honeybees have difficulty finding suitable places for their colonies. In addition, harmful pesticides and insecticides are likely putting additional stress on already weakened populations. Because one-third of the food consumed in the United States is dependent on insect pollination, with the honeybee being a major contributor, the loss of honeybees is a serious problem. It is important to bring our best scientific minds to bear on this issue.

According to the passage, honeybees are having trouble finding locations for their colonies because

A.	people are building in the honeybees' natural habitats.
B.	crippled honeybees are too weak to search for new habitats.
C.	suitable habitats are becoming infested with honeybee parasites.

She wondered what sort of dire circumstances could have led to the first time someone looked at an oyster and said, ""Hmm -- I think I'll eat this!"" It must have been starvation, Jane told herself.

In the 1700s, mineral water found in natural springs was said to have curative properties and was therefore in high demand. People wanted not only to drink mineral water but also to bathe in it. When scientists discovered that carbon dioxide caused the bubbles in natural mineral water, it wasn't long before people discovered how to carbonate water. In 1767, Dr. Joseph Priestly -- the English chemist credited with having first discovered oxygen -- made the first glass of drinkable carbonated water. Believed to have medicinal properties, this manufactured mineral water was sold primarily by pharmacists who added herbs to the beverage to enhance its effects. Today, soda is obviously not considered a medicine and, with high amounts of artificial sweeteners and other additives, its overuse has been linked to numerous health problems, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The interior, as seen through the window, caused him to draw up with a terminative air and watch. The house was rather large for a cottage, and the door, which opened immediately into the living-room, stood ajar, so that a ribbon of light fell through the opening into the dark atmosphere without.

It was so far off, and so many bad things happened there, that one's mother and grandmother and grown-up aunts cried at the railroad station, and one was expected to be sad and quiet for the rest of the day, when the father departed for Russia. After a while there came to my knowledge the existence of another division, a region intermediate between Polotzk and Russia.

Many feline fossils have been discovered over the years, but the skeletons of domesticated cats are much too similar to wild ones, blurring the historical narrative. In 1983, however, a breakthrough occurred. Archaeologists discovered a cat's jawbone on the island of Cyprus. The jawbone was at least 8,000 years old. Cats are not indigenous to Cyprus, which means that this cat was brought over aboard a ship -- no easy task if the cat was feral. In 2004, archaeologists found in Cyprus the remains of a human buried with a cat. These remains date back another 1,500 years. That makes 9,500 years, though some studies speculate that domestication started 12,000 years ago in the Middle East when agricultural societies flourished. With grain stores came mice, followed by cats, one of the earliest methods of pest control.

Major Frederick R. Burnham, a frontiersman turned conservationist, observed that populations of bighorn sheep were sharply declining and appealed to the youth group to take up the cause. For two years, more than 10,000 volunteers campaigned to protect bighorn sheep through a ""save the bighorns"" poster contest, talks, and dramatizations on the radio and at school assemblies. As a result of the campaign, land was set aside for the establishment of Kofa Game Range (as the refuge was originally known). Its name was derived from an acronym for one of the area's most notable mines, the King of Arizona gold mine.

Several hundred acres of this habitat are found on the eastern half of the refuge, where fire-dependent bur oak and tallgrass prairie come together. This habitat has become degraded in many areas because fire and large grazing animals are no longer part of the landscape and because of the introduction of invasive, non-native grasses and shrubs. Refuge staff are focusing efforts on reintroducing properly timed prescribed fire as a resource management tool, as well as direct removal of aspen trees from degraded oak savannas. The reason oak savanna preservation is important is because the savanna provides habitat for a large number of bird, mammal, and insect species, including red-headed woodpeckers, black bears, deer, American kestrels, and eastern kingbirds.

Based on the passage, oak savanna preservation involves

A.	setting controlled fires.
B.	planting heartier aspen trees.
C.	the removal of invasive grasses.
D.	the removal of large grazing animals.

The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and put straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a little spelling, -- that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm.

Based on the passage, what did the pupils do before Mr. Wopsle's great aunt collected her energies?

Looking up, we could see them waving their arms from the rocks above and beckoning to us to join them in their refuge. We had both seized our magazine rifles and ran out to see what the danger could be. Suddenly from the near belt of trees there broke forth a group of twelve or fifteen [people], running for their lives, and at their very heels two of those frightful monsters, which had disturbed our camp and pursued me upon my solitary journey. In shape, they were like horrible toads, and moved in a succession of springs, but in size they were of an incredible bulk, larger than the largest elephant.

The potential to fight infection changed in 1928 when bacteriologist Alexander Fleming discovered a mold that inhibited continued bacterial growth. Fleming soon discovered that the concoction he labeled ""mold juice"" was capable of killing a variety of bacteria. By 1929, he published his findings but only briefly referenced penicillin's full potential. Years passed and in July of 1941, British scientists Howard Florey and Norman Heatley transported the mold from England to a United States laboratory in Illinois. It was in this location between 1941 and 1942 that Andrew J. Moyer helped to develop penicillin into a useful antibiotic. Although more development took place, these early findings launched one of the most important medical breakthroughs of the 20th century.

His Renaissance portraits of kings, courtiers, and regular folk made up entirely of the objects that represent them: a heap of vegetables is a gardener, with a turnip chin and cheeks of onions; a jurist has a nose of cooked chicken and a body of papers. ""Of the pleasure it gave the emperor and the laughter it provoked at court, there is no need for me to tell you,"" wrote the artist's friend about The Jurist. But the portraits were more than mere jokes. Arcimboldo's Four Elements, a group of profile busts, are detailed studies of the natural world as it was known in the sixteenth century. One of which, water, a grand lady with a crown of corals and a face of over 60 different fish and aquatic animals, is particularly fascinating, witty and unnerving at once. Arcimboldo was forgotten until the 1930s, when Surrealist artists discovered him. Though products of the Renaissance, Arcimboldo's paintings still surprise.

That was his most perfect idea of heaven's happiness: mine was rocking in a rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy.

Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it -- namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.

Joining the nearly omnipresent pelicans in spring and summer are the American avocets, with their elegant shape and arresting colors. The refuge is home to an estimated 14% of the continent's American avocet breeding population and hosts over half of the continental migrating population. Also on display during spring and summer are western grebes, herons, snowy egrets, and many, many varieties of ducks and duck-like birds. Toward the end of summer and early autumn, these visitors will move on, replaced by a November symphony of tundra swans, owls, bald eagles, hawks, and falcons -- in their white and brown feathers, they will be hard to spot.

Here I found the sun very powerful, and I was so much fatigued that I stepped into one of the cannon to compose me, where I fell fast asleep. This was about noon: it was the fourth of June; exactly at one o'clock these cannon were all discharged in memory of the day. They had been all charged that morning, and having no suspicion of my situation, I was shot over the houses on the opposite side of the river, into a farmer's yard, between Bermondsey and Deptford, where I fell upon a large hay-stack, without waking, and continued there in a sound sleep till hay became so extravagantly dear (which was about three months after), that the farmer found it his interest to send his whole stock to market….

Housed on the grounds of the Soldiers' Home, a simple cottage offered summer respite to four American presidents. Its heyday was in the 1860s, when it witnessed a quarter of President Lincoln's presidency. War plans, drafting of the Emancipation Proclamation, and preparations for his reelection campaign all occurred here. ""We are truly delighted with this retreat,"" wrote Mrs. Lincoln in 1862, and the president welcomed the daily commute this stay necessitated. ""I see the President almost every day,"" recalled poet Walt Whitman, who lived in the capital: ""Mr. Lincoln on the saddle generally rides a good-sized, easy-going gray horse, is dress'd in plain black, somewhat rusty and dusty, wears a black stiff hat, and looks about as ordinary in attire as the commonest man…. We have got so that we exchange bows, and very cordial ones."" A true-to-life statue of the president and his horse mark the cottage.

It is situated in a valley with the Tian Shan mountains to the south. Wild pears, apricots, and especially apples -- varieties that developed without human help -- have been growing here for millennia. Nowhere else do such wild forests exist. Scientists think that this and the sheer range of apple varieties around Almaty mean that this land is the birthplace of the fruit. But time may be running out for Kazakhstan's apples: urban development threatens the forests. As Kazakhstan's oil and gas boom expands, hotels and mansions are taking over the forests. But here in the U.S. -- thousands of miles from the apple's origin -- there may be hope. In the U.S., where the apple holds an important cultural place, only 11 varieties account for 90% of all apples sold in supermarkets. With growing concerns over decreasing agrobiodiversity, scientists and apple growers are expanding into heirloom varieties.

I can't relate to any of these fears and so I thought they all sounded kind of silly. But then I remembered my fear of snakes, ophidiophobia.

The success of Landsat inaugurated a new era in satisfying our desire to better understand the world upon which we live. Space-based observations have become an essential means for monitoring global environmental changes. The cumulative effects of processes that cause significant changes on the Earth's surface can be documented and studied by repetitive Landsat and other satellite images. Such images provide a permanent historical record of the surface of the planet; they also make possible comparative two- and three-dimensional measurements of change over time. For example, as images become available from future satellites, the new data will be used to document global changes in glacier extent by reference to the baseline Landsat image record of the 1970s. As our understanding of the interrelationship of global processes improves and our ability to assess changes caused by these processes develops further, we will learn to manage more wisely the use of our finite land and water resources.

I thought they occurred when stars burned out, but I discovered that what we call shooting stars aren't actually stars at all. In fact, little chunks of rock and debris in space are called meteoroids. They become meteors -- or shooting stars -- when they fall through a planet's atmosphere, leaving a bright trail as they are heated to incandescence by the friction of the atmosphere. Pieces that survive the journey and hit the ground are called meteorites. Meteoroids are hitting Earth's atmosphere all the time, but the best time to see them is during a meteor shower.

He said, if an animal is going to jump out in front of your vehicle there's nothing you can do about it. I agreed that drivers can't control wildlife, but if you're travelling at the speed limit chances of having time to stop are greater. I also encouraged him to be especially careful at dawn and dusk. He laughed saying, he's always in bed at dawn. Still, many animals are most active at these times. Finally, I told him in unfortunate cases when a collision is unavoidable he should brake firmly, grip the steering wheel tightly, and stay in his lane as he brings the car to a controlled stop.

Nearly all French hotel bedrooms that I have ever been in seem to have a surplusage of doors; it may be due to the same idea as when, in the case of a theater, numerous exits are provided to ensure the safety of the audience; but, whatever the reason, the fact remains that the doors are largely in excess of what we consider necessary in England. Sometimes, indeed, one can hardly see the room for the doors! Sometimes, again, besides having a few dozen doors on each side of the bedroom, the windows open on to a balcony which is connected with all the other bedrooms on that side of the hotel, and, to give as much insecurity as possible, the windows decline to shut!

Though cutting back on products they'd grown to enjoy was no easy endeavor, Americans found ways to contribute to the war effort on the home front, while their loved ones fought hard on the battlefield. Gasoline was one of the first things to be rationed, not solely to save it, but to discourage people from driving and wearing out their tires. Rubber was a valuable commodity when the Japanese took control of Southeast Asia. One of American's primary sources of natural rubber, this region became inaccessible, which in turn made supplies scarce. Metal was also collected in massive quantities. Scrap metal drives became common and old trolley tracks, buried years before, were unearthed and recycled for the building of ships, tanks, and planes. Keeping the public fed was also a top priority, and rationing of canned goods, meats, and sugar forced households to make do with less. Truly a collaborative effort, World War II was fought by both soldiers and everyday citizens.

Mrs. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.

Which of the following literary techniques does the author use to describe the brook?

They left the house at noon to explore the rows of dried up corn stalks on the neighbor's farm. It was about mid-afternoon when Galeno heard something that got his attention and went exploring, bolting suddenly out of sight. ""Galeno,"" she cried out loud, ""Galeno!"" The only clue to his location was a faint sound several yards away. ""How did he move so fast?"" thought Mia aloud. Mia's panicked running through the sharp-edged, dry corn leaves lacerated her arms and also muffled any sound that Galeno might have made as he ran. So she had to stop and listen. Except for a gentle breeze through the corn making it sway slightly, there was only silence. She trekked on until evening, deciding to leave the corn field before it was completely dark to search the neighbor's adjacent barn. As soon as she cleared the field, she saw Galeno! He was running around like the puppy that he was, being happily chased by the neighbor's cat, Mittens. ""So this is what got his attention,"" mused Mia.

According to the passage, when did Mia leave the corn field?

Suddenly, the mast of the sailing ship was ablaze with an eerie blue light, the air around it crackling with energy. The crew stood motionless, some gazing in awe, others too terrified to move a muscle. St. Elmo's fire hissed as it lit up the deck. The captain watched in disbelief as the needle on his compass spun like a wheel of fortune. Tucking the compass into his vest pocket, Captain Wren shook his fist at the violent skies -- the wind and rain slowed and the glow from the mast disappeared. He thanked his lucky stars.

Paul, born in 1915 in Waukesha, Wisconsin, showed an early interest in both technology and music. As he began a career in music, he was dissatisfied with contemporary electric guitar designs. He felt that the guitars' hollow bodies produced too much distortion and vibration, resulting in a lower-quality sound. Paul built a solid-body electric guitar in 1941 and continued to make improvements to its design throughout the 1940s. His initial efforts to commercialize the design were met with resistance from guitar manufacturers, but Gibson Guitars finally decided to release his design in 1952, and it became one of the best-selling models of all time. The Gibson Les Paul, along with some of Paul's recording and engineering innovations, combined to form his signature sound. In the 1950s, Paul recorded many hit records with his wife Mary Ford. Today, Les Paul is celebrated for his influential role in the development of modern musical sounds.

Based on the passage, Les Paul designed his own guitar because

A.	he didn't like the sound qualities of contemporary ones.
B.	instrument manufacturers resisted his innovations.
C.	contemporary ones didn't produce enough sound.

There are no traffic jams in the sky. And Daryl had never heard of birds running into each other. It would be wonderful to be able to fly directly wherever you wanted to go and not have to follow rough and bumpy roads, dodge potholes, or get lost because the navigational system broke down. And if you got tired, you could just sit in a tree for a while, maybe even take a nap. Daryl wished for wings, but since that wasn't going to happen, flying in airplanes would have to do.

The image on the first cent was of a lady with flowing hair, symbolizing liberty. The coin was larger and made of pure copper, while today's smaller cent is made of copper and zinc. In 1857, Congress authorized the Mint to strike the cent with 88 percent copper and 12 percent nickel. The new cent showed a flying eagle on the front and a wreath on the back. From 1909 to 1958, the Lincoln obverse was paired with a reverse that featured a wheat design in which two sheaves of wheat flanked the words ONE CENT and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. It is commonly known as the ""wheat penny."" From 1959 to 2008, the reverse featured an image of the Lincoln Memorial to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth.

The tools used by carvers consist for the most part of chisels and gouges of different shapes and sizes. The number of tools required by professional carvers for one piece of work varies in proportion to the elaborateness of the carving to be done. They may use from half a dozen on simple work up to twenty or thirty for the more intricate carvings, this number being a selection out of a larger stock reaching perhaps as many as a hundred or more. Many of these tools vary only in size and sweep of cutting edge. Thus, chisels and gouges are to be had ranging from 1/16th of an inch to 1 inch wide, with curves or ""sweeps"" in each size graduated between a semicircle to a curve almost flat. Few carvers, however, possess such a complete stock of tools as would be represented by one of each size and shape manufactured….

First of all, the condition of a stamp is a very important consideration; stamps are rated in condition from poor to superb. Badly torn and mishandled stamps are not only unpleasant to the eye, but also worth next to nothing when compared to their undamaged counterparts. Protect stamps by handling them with stamp tongs. A magnifying glass, perforation gauge, and watermark detector are additional tools that are helpful for collectors. Perhaps the most important tool, however, is a stamp catalog. Stamp catalogs are simply reference books with illustrations helping you to learn about the stamps you have or are interested in getting. There are many catalogs in different formats but most will give you vital stamp information, like issue date, printing methods, and estimated values of used and uncirculated stamps. If you're not sure where to start, go to your local public library and ask a librarian. They will likely help you find a stamp catalog in the stacks.

According to the passage, which of the following will help you protect stamps?

A.	tongs
B.	catalogs

The canal ran 184 miles from Washington, D.C. to western Maryland and followed a course roughly parallel to the Potomac River. Construction of the canal began in 1828 and took twenty-two years to complete. During its construction the work site became home to many of its laborers, craftsmen, and engineers. Coal companies, merchants, and farmers alike used the canal to transport goods to the market. Cargo was shipped on boats hauled by mules on the towpath next to the canal. The C&O operated for nearly a century -- surviving construction delays and even the Civil War -- before closing in 1924 due to competition from the faster and more dependable Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Although it is no longer used for commercial shipping, the canal and some of its historical buildings have been preserved by the United States National Park Service. Today, the canal and its surrounding area are visited by millions of people every year for their history and natural beauty.

Located in the Pacific Ocean over 3,500 miles southwest of Honolulu, the trench was formed by the collision of two plates in Earth's crust in a process known as subduction. Due to its extreme depth, the water pressure at the bottom of the trench exceeds eight tons per square inch -- imagine fifty jumbo jets piled on top of one person! That's a lot of crushing pressure. Nonetheless, certain organisms have adapted to the extreme conditions of the trench, and life thrives in its depths. The floor of the trench has hydrothermal vents, or holes where hot water and acidic fluids from below Earth's crust shoot through the ocean floor. These vents support life, such as bacteria, crustaceans, and even fish. The trench has barely been explored, so scientists hope to learn even more about the biological and geological properties that make it unique.

I wrote Indiana during the autumn of 1831. It was my first novel; I wrote it without any fixed plan, having no theory of art or philosophy in my mind. I was at the age when one writes with one's instincts, and when reflection serves only to confirm our natural tendencies. Some people chose to see in the book a deliberate argument against marriage. I was not so ambitious, and I was surprised to the last degree at all the fine things that the critics found to say concerning my subversive purposes. Criticism is far too acute; that is what will cause its death. It never passes judgment ingenuously. It looks for noon at four o'clock…and must cause much suffering to artists who care more for its decrees than they ought to do.

But she was also a bit scared that the balloon lacked a motor, steering, and brakes. There was only hot air and a breeze to carry you wherever it wanted. Arriving at an open field, she watched as huge gas burners were lit with a large fan blowing the hot air into the bottom end of the balloon, which was lying on its side, being held open by two people who looked like they had done this many times before. They seemed like they knew what they were doing -- that gave her some comfort. The balloon slowly inflated until it eventually pivoted from its side, upward, ready to go. The pilot deftly jumped into the balloon's basket. Still lit, the huge gas burners seemed too close overhead. ""Is this really safe?"" she wondered. As she climbed in herself, the wicker basket creaked, making her more nervous still. Before she could change her mind though, they were twenty feet in the air and rising, but it felt like standing on the ground. She looked down onto the treetops, relaxed, and smiled.

Here are some tips to make your kitchen garden grow. In early spring and fall, plant spinach, peas, lettuce, onions, and other plants that need cool nights. Peppers, squash, tomatoes, green beans, melons, okra, and corn need warm nights, so plant these after the last spring frost. Consider height and breadth of the mature plants when thinning or planting seedlings. Bush varieties are more compact, and pole or vine varieties use vertical space effectively. Instead of using pesticides, consider organic gardening by including beneficial insects (like lacewings), mulching, or choosing non-toxic compounds. Finally, water in early morning or late evening to reduce water loss to evaporation. Not only is your own kitchen garden a good source of healthy and fresh food, but the gardening experience itself can be rewarding. So, consider your options and get started!

The aim, therefore, of patriots, was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty. It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable. A second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power.

During periods of low humidity, the resulting flakes are typically simple in structure, while high humidity often produces flakes with more intricate patterns and branching. Temperature contributes in much the same way, with certain structures occurring within certain degree ranges. Simple, solid prisms are some of the most rudimentary types of snowflakes, but can range in appearance from flat hexagonal plates, to thin, columnar sticks. At the other end of the complexity spectrum lie stellar dendrites, which have a tree-like pattern that we most often associate with snow. Hollow and capped columns, as well as bullet rosettes, double plates, and rimed crystals are just a few of the other classifications of snowflakes. Within each of these classifications are sub-varieties, which demonstrate the endless combinations formed under an array of atmospheric conditions.

Believed to have first been cultivated nearly 5,000 years ago, the earliest domesticated roses were derived from wild specimens, known as species roses. Among some of the first known varieties were Albas, Gallicas, and Centifolias. Over time, these were hybridized and refined to not only produce a wider array of colors, but to also bloom multiple times during a single growing season. Napoleon’s wife, Empress Josephine, was an avid rose gardener and is credited with creating the first official rose garden, located just outside of Paris at Chateau de Malmaison. Her interest popularized the cultivation of roses among breeders that contributed to the development of thousands of varieties. Breeders began using methods to achieve specifically desired outcomes, rather than relying on chance outcomes to produce new specimens. Today, roses come in a seemingly endless variety of colors, shapes, sizes, and fragrances.

Around 500 BC, the Greek philosopher Thales discovered that when amber was rubbed with silk or a dry cloth, other materials would be attracted to it; we now refer to this phenomenon as static electricity. Little progress was made in understanding Thales' discovery until the 17th century, when William Gilbert found that besides amber, other substances such as glass and diamonds could acquire static electricity. In the same century, Otto von Guericke invented an electrostatic generator, which applied friction against a spinning sphere of sulfur to produce static electricity. About a decade later, von Guericke learned that the electricity produced from his generator, when applied to a sulfur ball, could cause it to glow. In the 18th century, Steven Gray  discovered that some metals could conduct electricity, while other materials could not. Scientists and inventors of that era, like Pieter van Musschenbroek, Benjamin Franklin, and Allessandro Volta, followed suit, learning more and building on the information gained over two millennia.

According to the passage, who first experimented with sulfur?

A.	Gray

Skilled and powerful hunters, Komodo dragons use their long forked tongue to both taste and smell, and they can spot objects from almost 1,000 feet away. Komodo dragons are masters of camouflage and patience, often waiting for the perfect moment to ambush their unsuspecting prey. However, it’s the Komodos’ venom that makes them formidable predators, for it renders their prey defenseless. Indigenous to the Indonesian islands, the numbers of these endangered reptiles have been reduced by volcanic activity, earthquakes, and loss of habitat.

Based on the passage, Komodo dragons are endangered in part because of

A.	habitat loss.
B.	lack of prey.

In 1917, he was hospitalized with a brain concussion after falling 15 feet into a shell hole while searching in the dark for a lost soldier. This injury, along with a diagnosis of shell shock, led to a series of hospital visits for several months that year. In the hospital, he met Siegfried Sassoon, another poet who would become his mentor. During this time, Owen wrote the poems ""Anthem for Doomed Youth"" and ""Dulce et Decorum Est"" inspired by his intense firsthand combat experiences. Though Owen’s poetry is recognized as some of the finest for its subject material, his work has also received critical acclaim for its art and technique.

Rather, according to many researchers, the hyena’s laugh is actually an expression of frustration, tension, and conflict. The social structure of hyena colonies is very complex and hierarchical, and dominant hyenas have priority access to food. Studies have shown that when a group of hyenas eats, dominant hyenas crowd out subordinate hyenas, essentially denying subordinates access to food. As a result, subordinate hyenas will start to giggle. The pitch and volume of the laugh are related to the individual hyena’s age and social standing. To maintain a large, complex nocturnal society, hyenas rely on sound to communicate. In addition to laughter, hyenas make other, sometimes sinister-sounding, noises including various groans and whoops.

Based on the passage, a hyena’s laugh signals

She proved an indispensable companion to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their early 1800s expedition across North America to the Pacific Ocean. While she provided invaluable services as a Shoshone translator, she also guided Lewis and Clark through terrain unfamiliar to them. These skills were enough to preserve her reputation as an important American explorer, but it’s remarkable to add that she was pregnant when she started the journey, gave birth along the way, and carried her newborn child with her until the journey's end. In addition, Sacagawea possessed a calm demeanor that proved helpful under stress, including when one of the expedition’s boats capsized on the freezing Missouri River. While many crewmembers panicked, she proceeded to quietly reach into the water to fish out several documents and articles necessary for the success of the mission. While Lewis and Clark are duly celebrated as American pioneers, most people agree that they couldn’t have succeeded without Sacagawea.

Vampire bats are real, for instance, but they pierce their prey with small fangs, not giant, blood-sucking fangs. Another myth is that people frequently contract rabies from malicious bats. This is actually a very rare occurrence, as bats tend to avoid people altogether. Perhaps the most popular misconception is that all bats are blind. Contrary to popular belief, many bat species can see quite well. They simply rely more on echolocation, rather than vision, to navigate in the dark. Bats emit streams of high-pitched sound undetectable to human ears. The sounds bounce off nearby objects, producing the echoes by which bats can determine the location, size, and shape of surrounding objects. In fact, this remarkable ability allows them to ""see"" better than most creatures. So, next time you hear someone say ""blind as a bat,"" you may want to interject and debunk this popular myth.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Bats use hearing and vision in equal measure to detect their prey.

One of the most enduring contributions to philosophy by the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, the Socratic Method is still used in today’s law schools and has been adapted for use in the business world. In a business context, the first step of the Socratic Method is to identify the problem. The second step is to generate as many solutions as possible to address the identified problem. During this step, even the wildest, most outrageous solutions are welcome. Third, each solution must be carefully evaluated and scrutinized. If, in evaluating a solution, a ""counterexample"" is generated -- that is, a scenario in which the possible solution fails -- then this solution should be discarded. If a solution passes the third step, then the fourth step entails the solution’s actual implementation. The final step is to evaluate the outcomes of the solution.

Based on the passage, when applying the Socratic Method, what step should be done immediately after generating many possible solutions to a problem?

Some time passes when a goat happens across the well and, not knowing the fox is stuck, asks the fox if the water is any good. The fox purposely conceals his predicament and exaggerates by telling the goat the water is excellent. Encouraged by this news, the goat leaps down and, after reaching the bottom, realizes that they are both stuck. The fox proposes a solution. The fox will boost himself up by running up the goat’s back and, once out of the well, he will assist the goat in climbing out. Unfortunately for the goat, the fox is not true to his word and leaves the goat stranded in the well. The moral of the story is: Be careful who you trust.

It is equally important, however, to teach them what to do in the event that a fire starts. Many children are already familiar with the ""stop, drop, and roll"" protocol, but they often get confused about when to do this. The first thing to teach children is to use this procedure only when their clothing catches fire, and not when they burn their finger on a hot surface, or whenever they hear a smoke alarm. Teach them that if their clothing catches fire, they should stop where they are. Then, tell them to drop to the ground while using their hands to cover their eyes and mouth. Next, roll over and over, back and forth, until the flames have been completely smothered. Finally, instruct them to get immediate help from a grown-up who can get them medical attention.

First, cut a square from the plastic bag and poke a small hole in the center of it. Next, cut the square in such a way as to turn it into an octagon. Then, poke a hole near the edge of each side so that you have a total of eight holes around the edges. Cut the string into eight equal pieces and attach each piece of string to one of the eight holes. Attach the opposite end of each piece of string to the action figure. Lastly, find a high spot from which you can drop the parachute. Hopefully, your action figure descends slowly and safely to the ground.

The viceroy butterfly, for example, closely resembles the awful-tasting monarch, tricking predators into avoiding it as well. Other creatures rely on light and shade to blend in with their surroundings. The smooth coat of a white-tailed deer fawn has white spots, which at a distance appear to be patches of sunlight against the dark ground, thereby allowing it to blend in to the forest floor. Fish also employ light and dark through countershading. The top of the fish is usually dark, allowing it to blend in with the blackened depths beneath when viewed from above, while the underside is light in color, allowing it to blend in with the sunlight on the water's surface when viewed from below. Another form of camouflage involves color. Many animals, such as the rabbit and weasel, change the color of their fur depending on the season. Brown for the warmer months, and white for when snow covers the ground.

Although Latin is technically a dead language -- that is, a language that is no longer used by any group of people on a daily basis as their main form of communication -- it is widely considered to be one of history's most important languages. It forms the basis of many modern languages, including French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian, which are all considered Romance languages. That term was derived from the word Rome, the ancient empire in which Latin was spoken. Learning Latin will make learning any modern Romance language much easier, especially Italian, which has not evolved away from Latin as much as the other Romance languages. In addition, English, although Germanic in origin, borrows widely from Latin, and a person's English vocabulary can be enhanced by recognizing the meaning of original Latin roots. The Latin term fides, for example, means ""trust"" and is embedded in English words such as ""confide,"" ""fidelity,"" and ""affidavit.""

Achieving wind speeds of up to 300 mph, tornadoes are formed at the intersection of two fronts, one containing warm air and the other cold. When these two air masses collide, a thunderstorm develops and the potential for tornadoes increases. Mesocyclones, sometimes called ""supercells,"" are the type of thunderstorms most often associated with tornadic activity. Characterized by their rotation, these powerful storms typically produce heavy rain, lightning, and hail. The severity of a tornado is rated according to a numeric system known as the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale), which categorizes twisters based on their maximum wind speed. This graduated scale ranges from an EF-0 tornado, achieving speeds of 65 to 85 mph, to an EF-5 tornado, reaching over 200 mph. The vast majority of all tornadoes rate below an EF-3, but there is a slim chance, .01%, that a storm may develop into a devastating EF-5.

There are several benefits to using hydroponics, not the least of which is the ability to grow crops throughout the year, despite environmental changes. In addition, hydroponic plants tend to grow more rapidly, have bigger yields and take up less space than those grown traditionally -- indeed, an apartment window can be converted into a prolific garden. Perhaps the most beneficial aspect of hydroponics is that potentially harmful substances such as pesticides, insecticides and herbicides might not be needed. Without soil, unwanted microorganisms and weeds do not grow and cannot damage the plant or compete for the soil's nutrients. Due to these many benefits, hydroponics is becoming increasingly popular, especially among people in urban settings.

Some have come to believe that the phrase is an accounting-related term. Being ""in the red"" means being in debt, or having net losses; so the theory is ""Black Friday"" was named because retailers make up their debts -- getting back ""in the black"" -- through promotions and sales that attract droves of consumers on that day. While this explanation sounds logical enough, research has shown that the term ""Black Friday"" was actually first used in 1951 to describe anticipated worker absenteeism, rather than an anticipated rush of shoppers, on that day. It wasn't until the 1960s that the term was used to describe the shopping rush.

In fact, all primates -- with the exception of humans -- have whiskers. Whiskers, or ""vibrissae,"" aren't just overgrown strands of fur; they actually function as sensors and are connected to a specific nerve pathway that runs directly to the spatial processing center of the animal's brain. Whiskers are found not only around an animal's mouth but also above its eyes and sometimes between the digits of its paws. They allow animals to navigate through small dark spaces, helping them to sense the proximity of objects and to determine whether an opening is big enough for them to fit through.

Raccoons, turtles, fish, frogs, chipmunks, and bears are just a few of the critters that settle down for a long winter's nap. Before hibernation, animals must first store up extra food, either as body fat or stashed resources, so that they can feed on those reserves during the winter months. Then, a suitable location to hunker down must be found. Bears seek out tree hollows and rocky caves, while animals like frogs and turtles bury themselves in thick mud and decomposing leaves. Whatever its bed of choice, a hibernating creature then settles into a deep slumber, in which its heart and breathing rates, as well as body temperature, drop. Some animals, such as the chipmunk, wake up occasionally to eat food stores and defecate, while others like the bear, relying on their body fat to survive, tend to remain mostly still for the season's duration.

It became a popular sport during the European Middle Ages, but was not originally meant to be a spectator event to entertain crowds. In their infancy, jousting tournaments were designed to serve as practice sessions for the king's army. Just like in battle, jousters would charge one another while sitting high atop armored steeds. Using the tip of a lance, which was a weapon similar to a long spear, the jouster's main goal was to unseat his opponent and knock him to the ground. Later on, as the sport grew and competition flourished, additional objectives were added, as well as a point system that rewarded jousters for breaking their competitors' lances. Much like the professional athletes of today, successful jousters were idolized by adoring fans. Winning matches meant notoriety and money, as well as gifts of land and prestigious titles.

He was instrumental in founding the country's two-party political system and indispensable in establishing the modern Democratic party. However, his greatest contribution to the country -- indeed, to the world -- may be the very useful, transcultural term, ""O.K."" To be sure, van Buren did not invent the term. Debate abounds, but many researchers believe the term emerged from the odd 1830s phrase ""orl korrekt,"" which was simply a misspelling of ""all correct.""

This evaluation stems in part from his position as successor and predecessor of two of the nation's greatest presidents, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, the latter of whom defeated Adams after only one term. In fact, criticism of Adams at the time of his failed reelection campaign continues to color his legacy today. He was called a monarchist, an indecisive leader and someone with an ""ungovernable temper."" Adams has been correctly criticized for signing into law the Alien and Sedition Acts, which, among other undemocratic features, restricted speech that criticized the government. However, many historians agree that his decision to send a peace mission to France in 1800 -- rather than declare an all-out war with France, a popular position at the time -- may have saved the young American nation from dangers that could have resulted in its destruction. Adams' courage to hold unpopular views may have led to his tarnished legacy, but -- in at least one instance -- may have saved the nation.

I saw the last act of ""Tannhauser."" I sat in the gloom and the deep stillness, waiting -- one minute, two minutes, I do not know exactly how long -- then the soft music of the hidden orchestra began to breathe its rich, long sighs out from under the distant stage, and by and by the drop-curtain parted in the middle and was drawn softly aside, disclosing the twilighted wood and a wayside shrine, with a white-robed girl praying and a man standing near. Presently that noble chorus of men's voices was heard approaching, and from that moment until the closing of the curtain it was music, just music -- music to make one drunk with pleasure, music to make one take scrip and staff and beg his way round the globe to hear it.

Sure harbingers of spring are the Swallows. They are very common birds, and frequent, as a rule, the cultivated lands in the neighborhood of water, showing a decided preference for the habitations of man. How gracefully the swallows fly! See them coursing over the daisy-bespangled grass fields; now they skim just over the blades of grass, and then with a rapid stroke of their long wings mount into the air and come hovering above your head, displaying their rich white and chestnut plumage to perfection. Now they chase each other for very joyfulness, uttering their sharp twittering notes; then they hover with expanded wings like miniature Kestrels, or dart downwards with the velocity of the sparrowhawk; anon they flit rapidly over the neighboring pool, occasionally dipping themselves in its calm and placid waters, and leaving a long train of rings marking their varied course.

In the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to

A.	acclaim the beauty of swallows.

There is only one reason why all grownup people do not play with toys; and it is a fair reason. The reason is that playing with toys takes so very much more time and trouble than anything else. Playing as children mean playing is the most serious thing in the world; and as soon as we have small duties or small sorrows we have to abandon to some extent so enormous and ambitious a plan of life. We have enough strength for politics and commerce and art and philosophy; we have not enough strength for play. This is a truth which everyone will recognize who, as a child, has ever played with anything at all; anyone who has played with bricks, anyone who has played with dolls, anyone who has played with tin soldiers. My journalistic work, which earns money, is not pursued with such awful persistency as that work which earned nothing.

This otherwise unassuming lake is internationally known for being the alleged home of a large aquatic beast, the Loch Ness Monster, which is believed by some to be the solitary surviving plesiosaur. Long extinct with every other dinosaur, ancient plesiosaurs were gigantic marine reptiles with long necks. Others believe that the Loch Ness Monster is actually an archaeocete whale, a species that is also extinct. Others do not believe any such creature exists at all, given a lack of conclusive evidence. Extensive sonar and photographic investigations have been conducted without producing any definitive findings. In addition, the most famous photograph of the Loch Ness Monster taken in 1934 was a hoax. In spite of this, the idyllic and quiet lake has attracted many enthusiasts over several generations and continues to captivate people's sense of curiosity and wonder.

The slim little woman sat on the green bench in front of the curio shop, her eyes shifting with the crowd that passed inches beyond her knees. Too bad she could not enjoy herself in this vacation mecca. But she tried at least to relax, every time she thought of it. At these times she would straighten her small shoulders, remember how her hair always straggled in the heat -- for the August mugginess still hung over into the evening -- and feel for wisps to tuck under. Then her hand would go a little higher to touch the three pink roses on the hat. The roses looked nice. She had snipped new edges on them and pressed the veil over wax paper. The cotton dress was too wide in the neck, but fastened up with the brooch, it was all right. Appearance was unimportant anyway. She had come here with a purpose.

Would they be friendly to a person like me -- someone who hardly knows a word of Spanish? I was soon to find out. Arriving at my hotel, I found I no longer had my wallet, and immediately suspected I'd been the victim of a pickpocket. The hotel clerk, however, seeing how frightened and worried I was, checked me in without my identification and then sent me to the hotel's restaurant for dinner, though I had no credit cards. Later that evening, I was called down to the hotel lobby. Waiting for me was the cab driver who had driven me from the airport to the hotel. He had my wallet, and had gone from hotel to hotel until he found me. This was only the beginning of an unforgettable vacation.

But with just a little more work, superior pancakes can be made from scratch. Most pancake recipes call for flour, sugar, salt, eggs, baking soda, milk, and butter. Most households have these basic ingredients, and some fairly decent pancakes can be made with them. But with the simple addition of sour cream and low-fat buttermilk, the flavor is extra special. Allowing the eggs and buttermilk to come to room temperature before mixing results in pancakes that are lighter and fluffier. These pancakes are so much better than those made from a packaged mix, they justify the extra time required to buy additional ingredients and mix your own batter.

The line of people waiting to see this painting was long; it took quite a while before I finally came face to face with the painted image of this acclaimed portrait. Most people will tell you that part of what makes Mona Lisa so enduringly interesting is her mysterious smile. But what I noticed upon gazing at this renaissance-era portrait is that Mona Lisa has no eyebrows. Her eyebrows used to be there at some time in the past, say experts, but over the centuries, this delicate detail of Mona Lisa's face gradually eroded. One Parisian expert explains that the disappearance of Mona Lisa's eyebrows might possibly be the result of curators' efforts to restore and preserve the painting.

At first, I doubted the expense would be worth it. ""All I really need,"" I thought to myself, ""is just a little more experience; the last thing I need to do right now is spend money on new tires."" But after skidding off a snowy road and nearly ending up in a ditch, I resolved to revisit my friend's advice and bought snow tires.

The modern world thinks of Spohr rather as the composer of symphony, opera, and oratorio than as a wonderful executant on the violin; but it was in the latter capacity that he enjoyed the greatest reputation during the earlier part of his lifetime, which was a long one, extending from the year 1784 to 1859. The latter half of Spohr's life was mostly devoted to the higher musical ambition of creating, but not until he had established himself as one of the greatest of virtuosos, and founded a school of violin-playing which is, beyond all others, the most scientific, exhaustive, and satisfactory. All of the great contemporary violinists are disciples of the Spohr school of execution. Great as a composer, still greater as a player, and widely beloved as a man -- there are only a few names in musical art held in greater esteem than his, though many have evoked a deeper enthusiasm.

One legend tells that each mineral or gemstone had maximum power during one of the twelve months of the year. According to this legend, the gem for the month of November, for example, is topaz. The folklore associated with topaz holds that it could prevent sudden death, improve eyesight, and remedy insanity. Topaz was also said to help balance the emotions to help protect the wearer from succumbing to the temptation of greed. Other gems had different properties. For example, sapphires were thought to protect kings from harm and envy. People who couldn't afford to buy all twelve purchased only the mineral that offered protection during their birth month. Some think this is the origin of the birthstone.

These included covering the tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly, or touching it with something hot. Healthcare professionals, however, recommend against these practices. The most important thing is to remove the tick as quickly as possible. As soon as a tick is spotted, grasp it with fine-tipped tweezers as close to the skin's surface as possible. Then gently pull upward without twisting or jerking. If the mouthparts break off and remain in the skin, try to remove them with clean tweezers. If they won't come out, leave them; the skin will heal. Clean the bite area with soap, wash your hands, and you're done. This procedure might lack the drama of folk remedies, but it prevents tick bites from getting worse.

Long lines of bamboo, broken here and there by groups of pendanus or stately palms; islands of lilies and long sweeps of papyrus, spreading away from the banks on either side; the gorgeous foliage of aquatic plants drooping along the margin like a massive fringe, and relieved by clumps of tall, waving grass, formed a perfect Eden for the birds and monkeys that dwell among those scenes of an eternal summer.

The fruits do not yield their true flavor to the purchaser of them, nor to him who raises them for the market. There is but one way to obtain it, yet few take that way. If you would know the flavor of huckleberries, ask the cowboy or the partridge. It is a vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never plucked them. A huckleberry never reaches Boston; they have not been known there since they grew on her three hills.

Nature does not allow the land to remain bare and idle.

Yet I venture that those same persons furnish most of the pigweed seed that I use on my garden. The lesson is that there is no soil -- where a house would be built -- so poor that something worthwhile cannot be grown on it.

With the bill and webbed feet of a duck, and furry body and paddle-like tail of a beaver, the platypus appears to be a mixture of very different creatures. Monotremes, of the order Monotremata, are considered to be an ancient mammal order with an extraordinary mix of evolutionary adaptations. For instance, they share several physical characteristics in common with reptiles, such as having cervical ribs and laying eggs. Another unique adaptation of the platypus are the long venom-filled spurs on the male's hind legs. Some scientists theorize that the spurs are used for mating rituals. Found only in Australia, the platypus was almost hunted to extinction in the early 20th century. With conservation and protection efforts, however, these exotic creatures are no longer in danger and continue to intrigue and inform evolutionary biologists and anyone fascinated with one of nature's oddest creatures.

Nest robbing, trapping, and shooting first contributed to their downfall, followed by harmful ingestion of chemical pesticides and industrial pollutants -- including a pesticide known as DDT, which was finally banned in the early 1970s. Banning the use of DDT in the United States was a critical step, but the only way to ensure recovery was through the re-establishment of nesting peregrines. This called for intervention. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service developed a recovery plan and state wildlife services, law enforcement, land owners, and others participated in the effort.

The surprise was not that he was there but that he stayed there -- or rather he continued to hop -- with short reflective-looking hops and that while hopping he looked at me -- not in a furtive flighty way but rather as a person might tentatively regard a very new acquaintance. I may have been the first of my species he had seen in this rose-garden world of his and he thought I was only another kind of robin.

Beginning with 30 male and 100 female Russian Silver Foxes -- a species taxonomically close to dogs but never domesticated -- Belyaev permitted only the tamest of each succeeding generation to be bred. Tameness was defined only as showing the least aggression and fear response to humans. Other than tamability, no other breeding criteria were used. After only the tamest of some 45,000 foxes were bred over 35 successive generations, it was observed that the foxes whimpered to attract attention, licked and sniffed their caretakers, and wagged their tails when happy or excited. Unexpectedly, however, the tame foxes were physically different from wild foxes: many had floppy ears, short or curly tails, rounder faces, and more colorful fur. The experiment demonstrated that changes resulting in greater tameness -- a change in behavior -- led to physical changes as well.

In watching diseases, both in private houses and in public hospitals, the thing which strikes the experienced observer most forcibly is this, that the symptoms or the sufferings generally considered to be inevitable and incident to the disease are very often not symptoms of the disease at all, but of something quite different -- of the want of fresh air, or of light, or of warmth, or of quiet, or of cleanliness, or of punctuality and care in the administration of diet, of each or of all of these. And this quite as much in private as in hospital nursing. The reparative process which Nature has instituted and which we call disease, has been hindered by some want of knowledge or attention, in one or in all of these things, and pain, suffering, or interruption of the whole process sets in. If a patient is cold, if a patient is feverish, if a patient is faint, if he is sick after taking food, if he has a bed-sore, it is generally the fault not of the disease, but of the nursing.

Soon the cabins gave place to homes of boards of pine, of maple and of birch. Some of these homes were set close together for company, along a mile of road, which ran east and west through the valley. At the east end of this mile was the village green so the children of Castle Town should have a place to play forever.… And at the west end was the cobbler's shop. The bricks in the walls of that shop were the softest rose color, folk said, in all the world -- or at least in as much of the world as they had seen. The boards which went into the homes in the valley were the finest, the apples which hung on the apple boughs were a much better flavor than they had even been in Connecticut. And as for juice -- well you had only to taste the cider to judge that! While the fragrance lifting from the roses was such a sweet, though unseen, cloud that it made the hearts of all those passing through it beat faster, and their feet kept time as to music.

To describe Castle Town, the author largely employs

A.	personification.
B.	exaggeration.

A drawing of that part of the design which is to be cut on the key-block should first be made. This is done on the thinnest of Japanese tissue paper in black indelible ink. The drawing is then pasted face downward on the prepared first block with good starch paste. It is best to lay the drawing flat on its back upon a pad of a few sheets of paper of about the same size, and to rub the paste on the surface of the block, not on the paper. The block is now laid down firmly with its pasted side on the drawing, which at once adheres to the block. Next turn the block over and lay a dry sheet of paper over the damp drawing so as to protect it, and with the baren, or printing rubber, rub the drawing flat, and well on to the block all over.

The mother's call seemed to strike terror to the hearts of her infant brood, for, as I attempted to put the baby back into its crib, all four youngsters set up a loud to-do, and sprang, panic stricken, over the rim, tumbling, fluttering, and falling through the network of twigs to the ground, a couple of them rolling a few feet down the dusty bank. Again and again I caught them and put them back into the nest, but they would not remain there, so I was compelled to leave them scrambling about among the bushes and rocks. I felt like a buccaneer, a veritable Captain Kidd. My sincere hope is that none of the birdkins came to grief on account of their premature flight from the nest.

1366.	In the late 1800s, as railroads expanded ever farther across the United States, the demand for wood for railroad ties grew greater. It was found that the eucalyptus, a fast-growing tree native to Australia, thrived in Southern California. In hopes of harvesting wood for ties within a relatively short period, the Central Pacific Railroad planted nearly one million eucalyptus seedlings in the San Joaquin Valley from 1877 to 1878. It was soon discovered, however, that ties from eucalyptus wood quickly twisted and cracked, and could not hold spikes securely in place. Except for the fact that the trees made the barren landscape more beautiful, the plan failed. Remarkably, a couple of decades later, the Santa Fe Railway duplicated the same failure. ""Experiments have shown that the eucalyptus tree makes first-class ties,"" announced a company spokesman in 1906 as three million trees were planted on the hillsides of Rancho Santa Fe. That predictable failure exemplifies the saying that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

Turbulent social unrest arising from the young nation's first wave of immigration coincided with harmful environmental conditions contributing to a serious public health crisis. Socially conscious reformers began proposing the creation of a large public park, hoping it would improve public health as well as contribute to the development of a more civil society. A competition was announced, and in 1858, from among 33 submissions, the team of Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmstead was selected for the park's design. One objective of their plan, according to Olmstead, was to create an environment that would produce a sense of peacefulness that would soothe and restore the spirit. Now famous as Central Park, this first public park built in America now attracts more than 25 million guests per year. A monumental achievement of civil engineering that combines function with beauty, Central Park exemplifies the American ideal of using government to promote the public good.

In many ancient cultures, bread was made by using stones to grind grains into flour, adding enough water to make a dough, forming it into flat disks, and then baking those disks on hot stones near a fire. Such bread was flat, like pita bread. In one ancient civilization, however, raised bread was invented. Because of its location in the fertile Nile River Valley, Egypt raised vast crops of wheat. It is surmised that Egyptians invented raised bread accidentally when beer, another Egyptian specialty, was used instead of water, which had a great raising, or leavening, effect on bread dough. The flavor was superior. Soon, bakeries were everywhere in Egypt, and 40 different recipes for leavened breads and cakes were developed. So, every time you buy or make a sandwich, you might want to thank the ancient Egyptians for making it possible.

Flamingos live in lagoons or shallow lakes where they dine on algae and small crustaceans. These sources of nutrition contain carotenoid pigments that color flamingos' feathers. Some people also wonder why flamingos stand on one leg. Scientists aren't exactly sure, but one theory is that they do it to regulate their body temperature since the leg loses less heat if it's tucked next to the flamingo's body. Another idea is that it's simply a comfortable way for them to stand. No matter what the answer, standing on one leg and being pink help make flamingos unique birds.

One is to cool food completely before you place it in the freezer. Warm food can form ice crystals on its surface, and when you're ready to heat your food, it'll be covered in a pool of liquid. Another tip is to store food in airtight packages. Use freezer paper to wrap your food, then press all of the air out and tape the parcel shut. When freezing things that can't be wrapped in freezer paper, like soups and sauces, use large freezer bags. They're easy to stack, and bags don't take up nearly as much space as containers.

While the birds of prey -- the winged hunters which have so many resources -- drive away their young at a very early age, look upon them as greedy competitors, and force them by blows of their beaks to dwell afar from the domain which they reserve as their own, the spider is not contented with carrying its eggs in the cocoon, but, in certain species, nourishes them when living and greedy, guards them, bears them on its back; or else she makes them walk, holding them by a thread; if danger threatens, she draws in the thread, they leap upon her, and she saves them.

The levers are connected to a system of wires that cause clappers to strike the bells, creating the tones. To be considered a true carillon, the instrument must have at least 23 bells forming two musical octaves in a chromatic progression; instruments with fewer than 23 bells are called chimes. The weight of the bells can range from a few pounds to several tons. Once the bells are completed and tuned at the foundry where they are made, they retain their original tuning for life. The musician who plays the bells, the carillonneur, controls the bells' tone and volume by varying the amount of force applied to the levers. The structure that houses the carillon bells -- usually outdoors -- is called a campanile.

For example, vials of mercury have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs, and the Chinese were using it more than 4,000 years ago. Though used by the ancients for medicine, among other purposes, it was known by at least some of them to be highly toxic. This toxicity led people in the past to use mercury for such things as controlling mildew in paints and as a component in herbicides. Despite the toxicity, in the late 19th century, it was common to use mercury in preparing felt for making hats. Its noxious effects, however, led to the chronic poisoning of hat factory workers, affecting their central nervous systems and emotional stability -- this is likely where the term ""mad as a hatter"" comes from. The potential for poisoning eventually led to banning its use in the felt industry in the 20th century. Today, mercury is no longer used for any of these commercial purposes, but because it readily combines with other metals such as gold, silver, and tin, it continues to be a valuable mining metal.

And yet for a bird that has a wingspan of nearly six feet, flamingos are remarkably lightweight: on average, flamingos weigh no more than five to six pounds. Flamingos can fly but they seldom do -- they are, however, very good swimmers. With native habitats in Central and South America, the Galapagos Islands, and the West Indies, flamingos enjoy living in coastal salt lagoons and other saltwater or brackish shallow lakes. Widely recognized for their coral pink feathers, flamingos begin life with fluffy white feathers. As they mature, flamingo chicks' feathers change from white to pale pink and even to coral red, depending on where they live and what they eat.

To fill that time, they began etching highly detailed images onto walrus tusks and whale teeth and bones. To begin such a design, the sailor/artist would smooth out a print of a drawing over a tooth or bone, and then use a needle to prick the outline of the picture into the bone's surface. After removing the paper, the next step was to ""connect the dots"" by etching directly on the bone, completing the image. By rubbing lampblack (a pigment made from soot) or some other coloring agent over the etching, the picture would emerge in sharp relief as the smooth surface of the bone remained clean and the black would remain in the engraved lines. Called scrimshaw, this art form is now considered a collectible.

Resting on the ground's smooth surface are pebble- to boulder-sized rocks that move, seemingly on their own, sometimes for hundreds of feet. They leave distinct tracks behind them in the hard clay surface. Some trails are straight as an arrow; others are curved, with snake-like patterns. Some rocks make trails in the form of complete loops. NASA researchers suggested that a rare combination of rain and wind conditions enable the rocks to move. Others thought an exact combination of factors -- of the boulders being encased in ice, and floating on a small bit of water with sand underneath could move even large rocks with little wind. Recently, evidence gathered through video, time-lapse photography, and the use of GPS has answered the question of the moving rocks. Their movements are caused by the formation of floating ice. As surface water freezes it forms a sheet of ice, and as the ice melts and winds pick up, the rocks are slowly pushed along, leaving tracks and trails behind them.

Archaeological research in the Middle East reveals that people were making slate and obsidian mirrors at least 6,000 years ago. With the introduction of metal working, mirrors were made of copper and other metals that could be polished to a lustrous, reflective shine. Glass mirrors didn't appear until the Renaissance in Europe. Expensive to produce, glass mirrors were a luxury only for the wealthy. In 1835, however, a mass-production process invented by Justus von Liebeg that used silver applied to the back of the glass made glass mirrors an affordable item for most people. Now, it is hard to imagine a home without a mirror.

Based on the passage, the first glass mirrors were

A.	mass produced.
B.	backed with copper.
C.	found by archaeologists.
D.	used mainly by the wealthy.

But even the most simple cameras, when set in a manual mode, can enhance the control over a resulting image. There are four simple elements any photographer can control when taking pictures -- aperture size, shutter speed, the camera's sensor sensitivity, and white balance. The first three of these are about objective control over an image -- specifically how much light is required to capture the image. When an aperture is at its widest, more light is allowed to hit the camera's sensor (the part of the camera that captures the image). Shutter speed is simply how long the shutter stays open to allow light to pass through to the sensor. The sensor can be made more or less sensitive, depending on how much ambient light is present. And finally, white balance, a more subjective element of exposure, is the ""temperature"" of the light being captured (warm or cold). Using a camera's various manual settings can allow the photographer to adjust any of these four elements to capture images in any setting, with more control.

According to the passage, which of the following allows for more subjective control?

A.	aperture size
B.	shutter speed
C.	white balance
D.	sensor sensitivity

The Rat was sitting on the river bank, singing a little song. He had just composed it himself, so he was very taken up with it, and would not pay proper attention to Mole or anything else. Since early morning he had been swimming in the river, in company with his friends the ducks. And when the ducks stood on their heads suddenly, as ducks will, he would dive down and tickle their necks, just under where their chins would be if ducks had chins, till they were forced to come to the surface again in a hurry, spluttering and angry and shaking their feathers at him, for it is impossible to say quite ALL you feel when your head is under water.

According to the passage, what would Rat do so that the ducks would rise to the surface of the river?

1392.	Ever walk past a bunch of photographers and hear them talk about bokeh? The word, often pronounced to rhyme with ""okay,"" is the Japanese word ""boke"" that means blur or fuzziness. That sounds a bit strange for photography, which is nowadays mostly about exactness of focus. In fact, bokeh, in the simplest of terms, refers to the part of the photograph that is out of focus. To be more specific, it is about the quality or ""feel"" of the out-of-focus parts. Serious photographers care not only about the focused foreground subject of their shot, but also about the quality and character of the parts in the background that are not in focus. This quality is not controllable, however, because it is an artifact of the design of a camera lens. Lenses are designed by optical engineers whose attentions are on image quality and focus precision, not the quality of bokeh. Every once in a while, though, a lens is so good that it is able to render foreground images precisely in focus, but background images soft, unfocused, and, to some, full of beautiful, blurry bokeh.

According to the passage, bokeh is a characteristic that

A.	lens designers care about.
B.	depends on the lens optics.

Not all parts of a cave are the same, and therefore the types of flora, fauna, and fungi found within vary greatly. Insects and spiders, such as crane flies, ladybugs, harvestmen, and mites, along with larger creatures such as toads and bullsnakes, all live near cave entryways. They resemble the creatures we see every day. However, as you delve deeper into caves, the inhabitants become more unusual, because they have adapted to their unique environment. Often grouped together under the name troglobites, many of these cave residents have adapted to living in perpetual darkness. Blind salamanders and eyeless fish are just a few of the more than 7,500 troglobite species. Many of these organisms have small or non-existent eyes and pigment-free skin. Some are equipped with slow metabolisms, which allow them to go for long periods without eating -- essential to living in an environment where food sources can be scarce. If you ever get bored of the critters you see every day, try spelunking -- cave exploring -- but don't forget your flashlight!

According to the passage, which of the following is an example of a troglobite?

A.	ladybug
B.	crane fly

Benjamin Rush, often called ""The Father of American Psychiatry,"" wrote the first systematic textbook on mental diseases in America titled, Medical Inquiries and Observations upon Diseases of the Mind published in Philadelphia in 1812. The book went into five editions through 1835 and served as the major such textbook for almost 50 years. Rush was born near Philadelphia of Quaker parentage and received his medical training through apprenticeship and a medical degree at Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1768. He then toured medical facilities in England and France and returned to Philadelphia in 1769 to set up a private practice. Actively involved in civic and social affairs, he was elected to the Continental Congress in 1776, was a signer of The Declaration of Independence, served as a surgeon in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, and later was Treasurer of the U.S. Mint (1799-1813).

It was pleasant…to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road. Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the window. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared -- good-looking, undersized men -- wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.

The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver's hair from his face. As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead. The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odor of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.

Chocolate -- the candy often presented on birthdays, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and other celebration days -- is often presumed to be full of sugar and therefore consumed only in moderation. This cocoa-based snack possesses, however, some health benefits. Chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is rich in flavonoids, which are part of a family of antioxidants that help repair cell damage in the human body. The antioxidants found in chocolate may lower bad cholesterol, lower high blood pressure, and increase blood flow. Studies indicate that chocolate may even elevate serotonin and endorphin levels, which can improve mood and pleasure. With such benefits, chocolate is more than just candy; it comes close to being a health food. Of course, it depends on how much you eat!

Which of the following best restates the author's main point about chocolate?

A.	It is full of antioxidants.
B.	It has potential health benefits.

Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.

Some plants rely on the help of animals to spread their seeds, and this can happen in a variety of ways. Seeds embedded in tasty fruit are eaten by birds and other animals and then deposited elsewhere when that creature passes waste. Other plants, such as burdocks, produce seeds that are encased in pods covered in hook-like extensions, and rely on passing animals to hitch a ride. Water and air can also spread seeds. Equipped with either waterproof, buoyant husks like the coconut, or air-catching fluff like dandelion heads, these seeds depend on natural forces to carry them. Another example would be certain poppies that are designed like saltshakers and depend on the wind to ""shake"" their seeds loose. No matter the location or environment, plants have evolved a way to spread their seeds.

In discussing plants, the author's primary focus is on their

A.	stationary character.

After the Louisiana Purchase Treaty was ratified, Jefferson initiated an exploration of the newly purchased lands by securing funding from Congress. To lead the expedition, Jefferson chose his personal secretary, Meriwether Lewis, an intelligent and literate man who also possessed skills as a frontiersman.

The indifferent Alfred drove his unhappy burden towards the river. Walled in by the rush of snowflakes about him he made what way he could, but it was well-nigh impossible to see. The lamps gave no light, for the flakes had built a shutter across the glass like a policeman's dark lantern. The flying multitudes in the air turned him dizzy; he could not tell upon which side of the road he drove, and he could not tell what he would do when the wall beyond the outskirts of Chantilly forsook him. As to what was happening below him, what ruts, ditches, pits or hillocks he was navigating, he had no idea; his ship was afloat upon the snow, sluggishly rolling and heaving as it met with soft, mysterious obstacles.

Beginning in the early 1930s, the violent dust storms were the result of extended drought, poor farming practices, and overgrazing. These factors led to the destruction of native prairie grasses -- essential for stabilizing the topsoil. In 1932, there were 14 recorded dust storms. By 1933 that number had more than doubled and by 1934, approximately 100 million acres of topsoil had been stripped from the land. Homes and farm equipment became buried, cars were forced off the road -- their drivers unable to see, as the storms grew more ferocious and widespread.

Latterly the various tea-masters substituted various Chinese characters according to their conception of the tea-room, and the term Sukiya may signify the Abode of Vacancy or the Abode of the Unsymmetrical. It is an Abode of Fancy inasmuch as it is an ephemeral structure built to house a poetic impulse. It is an Abode of Vacancy inasmuch as it is devoid of ornamentation except for what may be placed in it to satisfy some aesthetic need of the moment.

Stationary, these animals secrete calcium carbonate to form a stable foundation on which to adhere. This skeletal structure allows them to spread across the ocean floor over time, approximately 0.3 to 10 centimeters per year. A piece of living coral is made up of many individual polyps, which feed by using their tentacles to sting and catch prey that pass by. Nearly one-third of all marine fish species will reside in coral reefs at some point during their lives, making the reefs a vital part of their survival. Extremely sensitive to temperature, salinity, and pollution, coral reefs have become threatened by human activities. Agricultural runoff containing pesticides and herbicides, as well as industrial discharge and sewage, all have negative impacts on reef communities and can lead to die-off. Management efforts are being put in place to protect these underwater communities, but reefs are continuing to disappear at an alarming rate.

The same pleasant atmosphere that was so noticeable out of doors, seemed to pervade the house. Mrs. Linden seemed perfectly calm, and free from the bustle and worry that was so common in my day when callers or visitors were in the home. To me she was a remarkable woman, with contentment and happiness written in her face. I had never seen such a face before. It was indeed beautiful. My friend ushered me into a spacious room, and asked me to be seated. ""Now,"" she went on, ""make yourself perfectly at home; anything you wish to know do not hesitate to ask me to explain. I have read so much about things that happened in your day, that I can hardly wait to hear your story but still as I wish my husband to have the benefit of it, I think I won't ask many questions until he arrives home.""

I am forced to admit that even though I had traveled a long distance to place Bowen Tyler's manuscript in the hands of his father, I was still a trifle skeptical as to its sincerity, since I could not but recall that it had not been many years since Bowen had been one of the most notorious practical jokers of his alma mater. The truth was that as I sat in the Tyler library at Santa Monica I commenced to feel a trifle foolish and to wish that I had merely forwarded the manuscript by express instead of bearing it personally, for I confess that I do not enjoy being laughed at.

To approach an official is sheer folly, as any tentative question is quickly calculated to work him up into a frenzy of rage and violence, while to ask your fellow passengers is equally useless as they are generally as dazed as you are.

Was Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to go for the information. He was not lavish, nor, on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously. He was, in short, the least communicative of men. He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.

Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages…. The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations. Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as ""historical"" in the children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer ""wonder tales"" in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.

Based on the passage, the author's main point is that modern ""wonder tales""

A.	must replace fairy tales from the past.
B.	no longer endeavor to instruct children.
C.	have no use for characters that frighten kids.
D.	retain the fun but not the fright of old stories.

Its existence in this dry environment is surprising enough, but it's the color of the water that makes this waterfall famous and gives it the name: Blood Falls. The water, remnants of an ancient saltwater lake trapped under ice for nearly two million years, is rich in iron. As the water escapes through the glacier, it interacts with oxygen to form rust, giving the falls a striking crimson color. Odder still is that this water hosts life. The subglacial lake that feeds Blood Falls is home to microbes that have managed to survive in a sunless, airless and cold abyss by converting iron and sulfate into energy. Perhaps they are the closest terrestrial examples of what ""alien"" life might be like. Could organisms like these have developed on Mars or Jupiter's frozen moon, Europa? The implications are astonishing.

According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), that discovery marked the first time moons were found to orbit a planet other than Earth and eventually led to the realization that planets in our solar system orbit the sun, not Earth. But this grand history is not what makes Europa truly special. Like Earth, Europa is believed to have an iron core, a rocky mantle and a saltwater ocean. This ocean is large enough to cover the surface of the moon, and being far from the sun, the entire ocean surface is ice -- a harsh welcome to any traveler. Underneath, though, the water is in constant motion: Tides rise and fall as Europa follows its oval orbit, warming the liquid to conditions that could sustain microbial organisms. It is that potential for life so far from Earth that so fascinates my friend.

It didn't look promising from the road, but at the end of a dusty drive, we found a cozy visitor center basking in quiet music -- native Hawai'ian instruments were being demonstrated as we entered. Beyond the center, several sunny trails meander to the ocean. The park preserves the coastal remnants of two ahupua'a (traditional land divisions) that used to link the upper slopes of the Hualalai Mountain to the shoreline. Ancient communities lived, farmed, and fished within these borders. Their fishing methods take pride of place here: The showpieces of the park, each lined with walls of lava rocks brought down from the mountain, are two fishponds, where fish were raised, and a fishtrap that lured fish during high tide. We also saw honu there, the green sea turtles. Lingering on the beach, we watched them play in the shallow water -- such a restful experience. We could have missed it all had we not taken that dusty turn from the highway.

It provoked a lot of thoughtful discussion. It got me thinking about what motivates individuals whose parents or grandparents were part of a persecuted group in the past. I think people live their lives ""ahistorically."" And what I mean by that is that people don't really, authentically connect themselves to the past. I believe what really matters though, even more than connecting with history, is empathy -- the only thing that can make a person change his or her mind.

Then, just as the sun began to set, it started: The underbelly of the bridge came alive with bats, hundreds of thousands of them coming out from every crevice. A fluttering black cloud of wings, they rose over the lake and disappeared into the evening -- the nightly hunt of North America's largest urban bat colony shaped itself before our eyes. This is a relatively new phenomenon. A 1980s renovation left thin grooves under the bridge, the perfect roosts. Mexican free-tailed bats soon settled in. Over time, locals came to appreciate them -- bats are excellent pollinators and a natural pest control. ""Freetails"" stay in the area March to October, but August is the best time to see them: That's when young pups take their first flight alongside their mothers, a flying mammal display unlike any other.

""You ought to have seen them last year,"" says his host disparagingly, and the visitor represses with difficulty the retort, ""You ought to have asked me down to see them last year."" Or, perhaps, he comes down in August, and lingers for a moment beneath the fig-tree. ""Poor show of figs,"" says the host, ""I don't know what's happened to them. Now we had a record crop of raspberries. Never seen them so plentiful before."" And the visitor has to console himself with the thought of the raspberries which he has never seen, and will probably miss again next year. It is not very comforting. Give me, therefore, a garden of my own. Let me grow my own flowers, and watch over them from seedhood to senility.

My favorite of its creatures, though, roamed the island millions of years ago, during the Cretaceous period, the time of dinosaurs. Beelzebufo ampinga, or devil frog, was large and had powerful jaws, spikes on its head, and a spine covered in a plate-like armor. The spikes and the armor may have protected the frog from dinosaurs and allowed it to burrow under earth during the arid season. The devil frog is a biogeographer's dream puzzle -- its closest relative is the South American horned frog half a world away.

Room after room brimmed with energy, one photograph more magnetic than the next. Sophia almost missed them all, for one image consumed her. She stood, frozen, breathless before it. Larger than life, yet occupying just one side of the shot, Marian Anderson sang, her eyes shut, her hair windblown. Avedon photographed Anderson, a celebrated contralto, in 1955, following her debut at the New York Metropolitan Opera. For the portrait, she sang Ulrica from Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera; that season she became the first African American vocal soloist to perform in the company. The power of her voice seemed to seep through the image. With a start, Sophia realized she had tears in her eyes. The crowds pressed, and with them, she shuffled on.

In the Washington, D.C. metro area, which endures some of the worst traffic in the world, a ridesharing system known locally as ""slugging"" has been around for decades. Commuters simply stand in ""sluglines"" at prearranged sites, often near public transit stops, and wait for drivers to pick them up for free rides. Vehicles with three occupants can use special traffic lanes, which ensures the journey will be faster. While obvious dangers do exist when riding in cars with strangers, drivers report that slugline passengers are usually courteous and may even become future business connections. Slugging can be seen as an informal transit system that is simultaneously time-saving, financially sensible, and beneficial for the environment. Perhaps new options arising from technological advances in communications, such as using mobile devices to coordinate meeting places and departure times, will further enhance slugging as a commuter solution.

Actually, independent bookstores have not disappeared completely. Indeed, some have experienced a resurgence in areas that support the ""buy local"" campaign, a movement that encourages spending money at local stores to help the local economy, ensure choice and diversity for consumers, and -- above all -- maintain the character of a community. Although independent bookstores have difficulty meeting the prices and range of available books offered online, stalwarts of this industry draw in customers by invoking nostalgia for a simpler time, offering reading recommendations and special reading events, and providing a haven for browsing in the midst of an increasingly high-tech, digitized world.

He reported his research in the Handbook of American Indian Languages (1911) and gave examples of four distinct root or base words that Inuit people used for snow. Examples of Inuit terms for very specific types of snow include aqilokoq to refer to ""softly falling snow"" and piegnartoq for ""snow that is suitable for sled use."" Various readers interpreted Boas's work to mean that the Inuit language had far more terms for snow than other languages had, with some claiming the number to be in the hundreds. Because the Inuit language makes liberal use of suffixes that attach to a base word to change its meaning, one linguist called the idea of hundreds of words for snow the ""Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax."" This is because grammatical flexibility allows for the creation of many Inuit ""words"" for any topic, not just snow. Resolving the controversy over how many Inuit words there are for snow requires the expertise of linguists.

Perhaps monks during the Middle Ages, tasked with copying manuscripts by hand, came up with the symbol as a shorthand way of writing the Latin word ad, which means ""toward."" Alternatively, the French word for ""at,"" a single letter ""a"" with an accent mark above it, may be the symbol's origin. A document from 1536 includes the symbol written by a Florentine wine merchant to indicate units of wine, which were called ""amphorae."" Centuries later, the ""at"" symbol was commonly used in commerce to mean ""at the rate of,"" as in ""3 pounds @ $1.00."" In spite of its usefulness in commerce, early typewriters omitted the symbol and, although it eventually found its way onto the standard keyboard, it wasn't much used. In 1971, the symbol became part of every e-mail address, separating a named mailbox or user identity from the host computer or domain name.

First settled in the 1600s, the island was once five miles long and inhabited by a thriving community of about 300 people. Over time the island slowly shrank as its land, which consisted mostly of mud and silt, eroded due to the forces of wind and waves. At its peak in the mid-1800s, Holland Island had a vibrant fish, crab, and oyster industry and was home to almost 90 fishing vessels and more than 60 structures, including homes, shops, a school, post office, social hall, and church. Attempts to arrest the diminishing shoreline with stone walls were to no avail, and by 1922 all residents had either dismantled their homes and moved to the mainland or simply abandoned their homes. Rising sea levels and continued erosion further reduced the acreage of the island, and at high tide it is now fully underwater.

For nearly 15 years, the partially constructed theme park sat silently on its hundred-plus-acre site, its most prominent feature -- a giant replica of a Bavarian castle -- shooting up incongruously into the sky. Besides the castle centerpiece, additional medieval-themed buildings were half-finished, and parking lot areas were cleared. After years of neglect, though, only rusting steel skeletons and cracked concrete remained where the colossal playground was to be. The ghostly site became a curious destination for photographers and something of a tourist attraction, while farmers in the area began reusing the land around and beneath the crumbling structures for crops.

I consulted a few homeowner resources and learned that there might be a few common reasons for my air conditioner's malfunction. I first checked for a simple error in the thermostat setting. After verifying the obvious -- the thermostat was turned on and set at the correct temperature -- I checked for a tripped circuit breaker and a clogged filter. Finding that the breaker was not switched off and that light passed easily through the air filter meant the trouble was beyond a simple solution. I could discount the condenser coil as the problem, because I had a technician clean it chemically last year as part of standard recommended maintenance. Based on my research, the problem therefore involved either fluid levels of the refrigerant, a cracked evaporator coil, a burned out capacitor, or some electrical issue, all of which were beyond the realm of my repair skills.

After I told this fact to my adult son when he began collecting, he shared additional stamp trivia with me, including the fact that stamps were actually treated as money in the U.S. around the time of the Civil War.

One of the most interesting behavioral traits of these otherwise unassuming creatures is their ability to vocalize differing types of danger to warn other squirrels. The ""alarm calls"" include single-note whistles that specifically indicate imminent aerial danger, such as swooping hawks and other raptors. Humans might interpret these whistles as having an altruistic purpose behind them. Don't the callers become vulnerable to attack by sounding the alarm while running for cover and allowing other squirrels to escape silently? Actually, it seems that whistling greatly enhances the welfare of the whistlers themselves. Though usually farther from a safe haven and closer to the predator, whistlers were found to be much less frequently captured or killed than the silent, alerted squirrels. The noise and action of many squirrels running in different directions appears to startle or confuse hawks and foil their attempted attacks. Rather than selfless, the whistling behavior is more likely related to squirrel self-preservation.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to discuss

A.	the function of the squirrels' whistling behavior.

Yet every drop of the wild blood in his splendid body was racing in a ferment of excitement that Kazan had never before experienced; every nerve and fiber of his wonderful muscles was tense as steel wire. Quarter-strain wolf, three-quarters ""husky,"" he had lived the four years of his life in the wilderness. He had felt the pangs of starvation. He knew what it meant to freeze. He had listened to the wailing winds of the long Arctic night over the barrens. He had heard the thunder of the torrent and the cataract, and had cowered under the mighty crash of the storm. His throat and sides were scarred by battle, and his eyes were red with the blister of the snows. He was called Kazan….

The hush of a golden May afternoon lay on the peaceful, watery streets of Leyden. Just enough breeze circulated to rustle the leaves of the poplars, limes and willows that arched the shaded canals. The city drowsed in its afternoon siesta, and few were about to notice the boy and girl making their way rapidly toward the middle of the town. Directly before them, the canal-interlaced streets and stone bridges gave place to a steep incline of ground rising to a considerable height. Its sides were clothed with groves of fruit trees, and from its summit frowned the mouldering walls of some long-forsaken fortress. So old and deserted was this tower that a great clump of oak trees had grown up inside of it, and overtopped its walls.

Working on specific techniques can add to your set of skills and behaviors for assertive communication. First, try to be simple and direct in how you face problems. Rather than avoiding confrontation, let others know your point of view by telling them what you really think as clearly and directly as possible. Second, acknowledge that you can simply say ""no"" to people without giving them a long explanation about why. Third, don't let aggressive communicators bully you, and be respectful of those who are passive communicators. If someone repeatedly asks you the same question after you've already given an answer, repeat your answer in a calm manner instead of getting argumentative. Be aware of your motivations and evaluate when it is appropriate to act assertively; sometimes it is appropriate to keep silent. By practicing these techniques, you will develop confidence in your abilities and be ready to benefit from healthier human interactions.

Which of the following best characterizes the tone of the passage?

A.	irritated

In 1951, Asch conducted an experiment in which one participant, the subject being studied, was placed in a room with seven others who were actually accomplices in the experiment. The subject believed the others were equal participants and was not told that they were accomplices. The researcher presented the group of eight people with two cards positioned side by side. One card displayed a single vertical line. The second card displayed three vertical lines of different lengths labeled A, B, and C. In turn, each member of the group identified which line on the second card matched the length of the line displayed on the first card. Beforehand, the accomplices were told to provide the same incorrect answer. Although that answer was obviously wrong, most participants, who always answered last, agreed with the clearly incorrect majority. One possible explanation for the outcomes of Asch's study is that people feel social pressure to fit in with a group.

Although Tevfik lived in Turkey, Ubykh originated along the eastern shore of the Black Sea, near Sochi, Russia. Due to conflicts in the 1860s between the Ubykh people and the Russians under Tsar Alexander II, Ubykh villages were destroyed, and tens of thousands of the Ubykh people relocated to Turkey. Forty years later, Tevfik was born in the Turkish village of Haci Osman. Witnessing the decline of his native language, Tevfik lent his expertise to linguists wishing to preserve and record it. By the 1980s, Tevfik was the only person capable of speaking Ubykh fluently, though a few tribal elders retained a handful of phrases. For more than a decade, Tevfik, who also spoke Turkish, was these linguists' only source of information. His cooperation led to the scholarly preservation of the Ubykh language, as well as of the mythology, culture, and customs of the Ubykh people.

In the summer, with the abundance of sweet, fresh fruit to supplement the meal, my granola is a simple combination of rolled oats, wheat germ, and nuts or sunflower seeds. Swapping out the choice of nuts and seeds throughout the year lends new flavors and textures to my granola, making the first meal of the day less routine. As the days shorten in fall, I add brown sugar, spices, and use raw pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Come winter, I sweeten the granola with bits of dried fruits instead of brown sugar and use toasted nuts instead of seeds -- usually almonds or pecans. My spring granola features soy nuts and sesame seeds. No matter the season, before adding fruit to my recipe, I toss all the other ingredients with melted butter and bake them just long enough to turn a lovely shade of brown and develop a crunchy finish.

In ancient Greece, days of the week were named after celestial bodies, which were themselves named after Greek gods, such as the god of war, Ares. The ancient Romans, who spoke Latin, assigned names to the seven days using their own deities, who were counterparts to the Greek gods. The modern English name Saturday derives from dies Saturni, which translates to ""Saturn's Day,"" referencing the Roman god of agriculture. The Romans' names for most days of the week have been retained in languages of Latin origin, such as Spanish; however, the English language switches to names of Germanic origins for Tuesday through Friday. For example, the Spanish name for Tuesday, martes, is a derivation of dies Martis in honor of Mars, the Roman god of war. But the English name Tuesday comes from the Germanic name for the Norse god of war, Tiw. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are named for the Germanic deities Wodin, Thor, and Frigg, respectively.

An embryo in the midst of splitting into identical twins stops midway through the process, leaving the twins joined. Most of the two-headed snakes that have been found have had both heads on one end of their bodies. However, an even rarer example has been discovered where the snake has one head on each end of its body, a form that is common in the mythology of several ancient cultures. Two-headed snakes are often found when very young, as most would not be able to survive into adulthood living in the wild. One reason for this is two-headed snakes often compete with each other for prey, which makes feeding a very time-consuming process, leaving them vulnerable to predators.

The Office quebecois de la langue française -- or the Quebec Board of the French Language -- is the Canadian government agency that some Canadians disparagingly refer to as ""the language police."" Originally established in March 1961, this board takes its mission from the Charter of the French Language, which states that the Board, among other tasks, ""shall see to it that French is the normal and everyday language of work, communication, commerce and business in the civil administration and in enterprises.""

The Cajun people of Southern Louisiana speak a dialect that blends English with several varieties of French, along with German and Spanish, as it is spoken on the Canary Islands off the northwestern coast of Africa. The dialect is referred to as Cajun English, and although Cajuns make their home in Louisiana, the English elements of their dialect differ from standard American English. Likewise, their dialect's French elements would be only vaguely familiar to the modern-day French speaker. This is not surprising given the Cajuns' roving past, which dates back to 1614, when they ventured out from rural western France to North America. Specifically, they immigrated to a place called Acadie -- now Nova Scotia, Canada -- where they dwelled for over 150 years. In 1755, Great Britain began expelling the Acadians from the region, and many of them traveled down the Mississippi River, finally settling in Louisiana, where ""Acadian"" would eventually be shortened to ""Cajun.""

Then, if it's granted, the person requests something bigger. If that's granted, the person then asks for something bigger still – and so on, until the original, hidden agenda has been achieved. One study measuring the effectiveness of this technique involved asking random residents in California to place a small sign on their front window that supported safe driving. A few weeks later, the experimenters revisited all of the residents who agreed to display the sign and asked them to comply with a new request: to place a large sign in the middle of their front yard to support safe driving. The compliance rate of this group was significantly higher than that of a control group (for whom the experimenters skipped the small sign request). This technique is effective because the first request often creates a bond between the requester and requestee, leading to greater compliance in the future.

Composed of three segments, the Link begins as a tunnel in Copenhagen, Denmark, its westernmost point. Spanning more than two miles underwater, the tunnel gradually rises to a roadway, the Link's second segment, built on an artificial island. Named Peberholm, which translates to ""Pepper Islet,"" the island complements the nearby natural island Saltholm (""Salt Islet""). The Peberholm roadway transforms into the cable-supported Oresund Bridge, the final segment that stretches to Malmo, Sweden and covers a distance of nearly five miles. The completion of the Oresund Link in 2000 marked the first time in seven millennia that the two landmasses were connected.

However, if each of these entries is unpacked -- for example, the word climb includes the words climbs, climbing, climbed, climber and climbers -- then English may very well exceed a million words, giving it an unusually immense vocabulary. Many obscure words exist in English that, because of how specific and descriptive they are, would enrich our daily conversations. Arachibutyrophobia, for instance, is an English word that means ""fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of your mouth"" -- not an uncommon condition.

The book tells of a great and often arduous journey through the Middle East and the Far East. According to the book, Polo befriended Kublai Khan, the Chinese emperor, who allowed Polo to stay in his marble palace and employed him as a special envoy to areas including Burma, India, and Tibet. Upon the book's publication, many people believed the tales were exaggerations and simply too good to be true.

Referred to as ""the face that launched a thousand ships,"" Helen of Troy is a figure in Greek mythology whose reputed matchless beauty led to the decade-long Trojan War between the Greeks and the Trojans. Courted by many suitors, Helen eventually married Menelaus, the brother of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae. However, a Trojan prince named Paris visited the Spartan court and, depending on the source, either kidnapped Helen or convinced her to leave Menelaus. Regardless of how their relationship started, Helen willingly married Paris in Troy. Outraged, Menelaus and Agamemnon assembled a Greek fleet and set sail for Troy. Once there, Menelaus gave the Trojans an ultimatum: return Helen or war will be inevitable. The denial of this request thus marked the beginning of the Trojan War, which would end in a Greek victory ten years later.

You're probably familiar with the ""caw"" of a crow, and the calls of these birds also include rattle and click sounds. By contrast, the most common raven call is a deep croaking, which you would never hear from a crow. You can also distinguish ravens and crows by watching them fly. Crows don't soar more than a few seconds but ravens do. If you're close enough to get a look at the bird's tail, it can provide another clue.

According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, there are four primary approaches to measuring drought: meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomic. Meteorological drought is region-specific and looks at the degree of dryness compared to an average precipitation amount, along with the length of the dry period. Agricultural drought concerns the agricultural impact of a lack of precipitation and takes into account the different amounts of moisture needed by crops during different stages of development. Another type of drought, hydrological, is based on how the precipitation deficit affects the water supply. Finally, socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic good exceeds the supply because of a water shortfall.

Flight feathers, also called contour feathers, make up the outermost layer of plumage and deflect rain to help keep birds dry. The largest contour feathers, located on a bird's wings and known as remiges, support birds during flight. Tail feathers, collectively called rectrices, provide birds with stability and control. Underneath contour feathers are filoplumes with special sensory receptors that send feedback about the feathers surrounding them back to birds' brains. This feedback helps birds maintain their plumage and aids flight. To keep birds warm, semiplumes and fluffy down feathers are essential. Finally, some birds have bristle feathers, which are stiff and usually found around the eyes and beak. These may protect birds from getting dust in their eyes and could help them sense prey. Critical for flight and insulation, feathers play a variety of important roles.

The Roman Marcus Vitruvius Pollio is credited with developing many of these conventions. The author of De Architectura, a 10-book collection of guidelines for builders, city planners, and architects, Vitruvius emphasized harmony and the importance of aesthetics in design. The distance between columns, for example, was integral in creating a functional structure. Favoring an arrangement known as eustyle when designing temples, he believed that columns should be spaced two-and-a-quarter diameters apart, allowing those visiting the building to pass through hand-in-hand without difficulty. Steps were also taken very seriously and had to adhere to a 2 : 1 ratio of depth to height. Inspired by the laws of nature, he felt that good design was firmly grounded in mathematics and reason, which was consistent with the ideals of the time.

However, at the end of my meal, most of the sauce remained at the bottom of the bowl. Angel hair is simply too delicate for a thick sauce. A thin, smooth butter or cheese sauce does a great job of coating thin pasta noodles. With a little experimentation, I've learned that pastas with grooves and crevices, such as penne, shells, or farfalle, provide the perfect nooks and crannies for chunky sauces. These heartier types of pasta also stand up to sauces full of meat and vegetables in baked dishes. I love the simplicity of these rules, but what I love even more is that they work!

The possessor of a garden, large or small, should have a seed-bed, where seeds of perennials and some of the annuals can be sown and grown until large enough to be permanently placed. Not only will this bed give great pleasure in enabling one to watch the plants from the time the first tiny leaf appears, but also when laden with blossoms in fullest beauty. The knowledge that you have raised them gives a thrill of pride in the result which no bought plants, however beautiful, can impart. It is not necessary to prepare the seed-bed over a foot in depth, but the soil must be very light and fine, as well as rich. It is best, if possible, to have a portion of the bed somewhat shaded from the sun for a part of the day. If this combination cannot be had in one bed, there should be a second for plants that want less sun. Biennials must, of course, be sown every year, as they bloom but once, then die.

If you intend seriously to market photographs you should possess an anastigmat lens; not necessarily an F/4.5 lens, nor even an F/6.3 lens if too expensive; in that case an F/7.5 lens will do very well. An F/7.5 anastigmat is slightly slower than a rapid-rectilinear of U.S.4 aperture; but its excellence lies in its ability -- as with all anastigmats -- to form images of razor-edge sharpness, which is a prime requisite of a print intended to grace a page of a periodical. A rapid-rectilinear lens will do very well if you are always assured of sunshine or bright clouds to supply exposure-light -- and in such conditions even the lowly single-achromatic lens will suffice.

According to the passage, which of the following types of lenses may be too expensive?

A.	F/6.3
B.	F/7.5
C.	rapid-rectilinear
D.	single-achromatic

As a result, I discovered some tips that have helped me hit the books. For example, I read that studying in different places can make it easier to remember what you learned. This works well for me because I study in the car while I wait for my kids, during my lunch break at work, and while dinner is cooking. I also learned the importance of staying organized. I keep a schedule and work hard to stick to it. This keeps me from wasting time by procrastinating. Another great tip is to get enough sleep. Without enough sleep, my brain is too tired to study. By taking these steps, I'm confident that I'll achieve my goals.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	The author will try different tactics to make a return to school successful.
B.	The author has a flexible job that allows for the attendance of school.
C.	The author's biggest hurdle to success is not getting enough sleep.
D.	The author's suggestions are unlikely to work for others.

An automobile man as well, Olds was the first automaker to deviate from the old ways, which called for one worker to produce each part from beginning to end. Taking a different approach, Olds assigned each worker a duty, such as inserting a bolt or tightening a screw. Each worker moved from car to car, carrying out their assigned duty. Not only was this practice quicker and more efficient, it brought down the cost of production dramatically. What Henry Ford is rightfully credited with, is the creation of the ""moving"" assembly line, which took Olds' concept to another level, by interjecting the use of a moving platform. This conveyor belt, which carried the product along to each worker's station, increased efficiency further. Thanks to this improvement, Ford's Model Ts began rolling off the assembly line at a rate of nearly six cars per minute, an unprecedented pace.

In discussing Olds and Ford, the author's primary focus is on their

A.	competitive natures.
B.	successes and failures.

Capable of delivering a 600-volt shock, this ribbon-like fish sits at the top of its food chain and needn't worry about being eaten by other, larger predators. These eels employ electricity for defense by using their shocking power to deter aggressive animals from attacking, and as a method of escape. The eel uses its electrical abilities in more ways than just for hunting food and defending itself. Because of its poor eyesight, and low visibility in the muddy waters it calls home, the electric eel must rely on a process called electroreception in order to sense its surroundings. Electroreception involves the emission and interpretation of small electrical currents to swim around obstructions. If you should ever run across one of these fascinating creatures, remember to take care. Though not particularly aggressive, electric eels will attack if provoked, and are capable of taking down a mammal as large as a horse when threatened.

According to the passage, an eel's electroreception is used to

A.	defend itself.
B.	digest food.
C.	navigate.

According to the Library of Congress, the acoustical recording process of that time favored loud instruments that projected well -- brass instruments such as cornets and trombones were picked up clearly by recording horns, but members of the string family were not. The Stroh violin provided a solution by replacing the violin's usual wooden body with a metal resonator and adding two horns to the instrument. While the large, amplifying horn directed musical tones toward the recording horn (a large, metal funnel used to capture sound for the recording), the smaller horn was positioned near the player's ear so musicians could monitor the sounds their instruments made. As acoustical recording techniques improved -- circa 1910 to 1915 -- traditional violins replaced Strohviols in recording studios.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	Stroh violin's use.
B.	Stroh violin's invention.

As papyrus was expensive the pupils in the schools attached to the great temples of Egypt wrote their exercises and copies of standard literary compositions on slices of white limestone of fine texture, or upon boards, in the shape of modern slates used in schools, whitened with lime.… Portions of broken earthen-ware pots were also used for practicing writing upon, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods lists of goods, and business letters, and the receipts given by the tax-gatherers, were written upon potsherds [ceramic pieces]. In still later times, when skin or parchment was as expensive as papyrus, the Copts, or Egyptian Christians, used slices of limestone and potsherds for drafts of portions of the Scriptures and letters in much the same way as did their ancestors.

He had travelled a lot, but had never left the North American continent. Though he was drained from his late-night cramming for exams, he was happy to have it all behind him and looking forward to new travel adventures and the challenges of starting law school at the end of summer. Until then, he would relax and take in all of the sights and sounds of Europe that he had been dreaming about since childhood. The day finally arrived. As he boarded the plane, he realized he had never taken such a long flight before and flying over the ocean made him nervous. He tried to settle his nerves by thinking about all the exciting things he had planned while there, by watching the in-flight entertainment, by listening to music, and talking to the passenger sitting next to him, but nothing worked. As soon as the plane touched down, he was relieved but exhausted from the flight. He caught a taxi to his hotel, took a shower to refresh, and started his grand adventure!

In the East it still survives, and it is not an uncommon thing to see a crowd at a street corner held by the simple narration of a story. There are signs in the West of a growing interest in this ancient art, and we may yet live to see the renaissance of the troubadours and the minstrels whose appeal will then rival that of the mob orator or itinerant politician. One of the surest signs of a belief in the educational power of the story is its introduction into the curriculum of the training-college and the classes of the elementary and secondary schools.

Oliver's band was playing at the Lincoln Gardens Cafe, which catered to a prospering and growing African-American population. During this time, Louis' musicianship increased, as did his reputation as a highly talented cornetist. He was first recorded in 1923 by Gennett Records while playing with Oliver's Band. Okeh Records also recorded the band before Louis left for New York in 1924.

Although the term ""calligraphy"" is derived from the Greek words for beauty and writing, calligraphy itself need not be beautiful or even legible to be considered good. Calligraphy dates back to 3500 BC, when Egyptian artisans began to carve hieroglyphics into stone. Phoenicians followed in 1000 BC with the creation of the first alphabet, later adopted by the Greeks and Romans. Throughout history, calligraphy's forms have been influenced by the devices and materials used to create them. Chisel and hammer on stone eventually gave way to stylus on wax, and later quill and ink on parchment. Each of these tools and mediums favored certain styles and techniques. Strokes in wax were more delicate than those made in stone, for example, and the broad, flat-edged pens used prior to the 19th century favored more rounded designs. No matter the era, tool, or style, calligraphy has long been regarded as a dynamic and vital art form.

Despite their popularity, attempts at commercial cultivation have not proven successful. Because of this, those looking to add them to their dinner table must obtain the delicacy the old-fashioned way, by hunting and gathering. Found mostly on the margins of forested areas, or alongside decaying wood, morels rarely occur in the same place every year, making them a challenge to locate. Generations of families have made this difficult search a yearly tradition, and continue to pass the ""hunt"" on to their descendants. Morels can be sauteed and eaten fresh as well as dried and reconstituted later, which is good, since they are such a rare commodity. Selling for upwards of $50 a pound, morels are definitely worth the effort for those who take the time to search them out.

This is typically done when the weather begins to warm, and its coat has already grown heavy over the winter. Once the wool is removed, it is graded based on quality and then cleaned during a process called scouring. After being washed, rinsed, and dried multiple times, the wool is carded, to eliminate any solid debris remaining. Next, the wool is combed to align the fibers and prepare it for spinning, which twists the fibers into useable threads. After spinning is completed, the threads must be thickened through a process called fulling. During this process, threads are immersed in soapy water and then stretched to compensate for any shrinkage that has occurred. At this point, the product is carefully trimmed and finished into a yarn. The yarn can be woven into any form, from a large blanket to a thin scarf, depending on the desired product.

Based on the passage, carding helps to

A.	remove unnecessary solid objects after scouring.
B.	grade the quality of the wool after shearing.
C.	stretch the shrunken fibers after fulling.
D.	thicken the threads after spinning.

Game theory is a way of looking at situations involving, in the simplest case, two sides (or ""players"") with ""payoffs"" or ""outcomes"" determined not only by what a given player does, but also by the interaction of both sides involved. Without this interaction, such ""games"" wouldn't be very difficult: Each player would simply do whatever it takes to get the best outcome, regardless of the other player. For example, if it is raining, the correct ""move"" may be to carry an umbrella, regardless of what the other does. The weather is unlikely to be influenced by anyone's behavior; each is therefore free to follow his or her inclinations, without regard to the other's course of action. On the other hand, imagine that two people discover, say, a small pile of money. They will likely be best served by taking the other into account. For example, they should divide the loot rather than each trying to monopolize the payoff and possibly fight over it as a result. It is when outcomes are determined by the interaction of two or more players that game theory has much to teach us.

Based on the passage, understanding storm planning doesn't require game theory because

A.	weather will not likely be affected by human interaction.
B.	neither weather nor human behaviors are predictable.
C.	no two people prepare for weather the same way.
D.	not everyone uses an umbrella in rainy weather.

In classifying the different dyestuffs and coloring matters it is, of course, necessary to consider first the properties of those coloring matters generally, and secondly the particular reason for making such classification. The scientific chemist, for example, would classify them according to theoretical considerations, as members of certain typical groups; the representative of medical science or hygiene would naturally classify them as poisonous and non-poisonous bodies; whilst the dyer will as naturally seek to arrange them according to their behavior when applied to textile fabrics. But this behavior on applying to textile fibers, if varied in character according to the chemical nature of the coloring matter, as well as the chemical and physical nature of the fabric -- and it is so varied -- will make such classification, if it is to be thorough-going, not a very simple matter.

Based on the passage, a dyer classifies coloring materials based on

As a peddler, I went through the various coal camps, eating in the homes of the miners, staying all night with their families. I found the conditions under which they lived deplorable. They were in practical slavery to the company, who owned their houses, owned all the land, so that if a miner did own a house he must vacate whenever it pleased the land owners. They were paid in scrip instead of money so that they could not go away if dissatisfied. They must buy at company stores and at company prices. The coal they mined was weighed by an agent of the company and the miners could not have a check weighman to see that full credit was given them. The schools, the churches, the roads belonged to the Company. I felt, after listening to their stories, after witnessing their long patience that the time was ripe for revolt against such brutal conditions.

Most people are familiar with this very simple song, known today as ""Chopsticks."" The odd title is said to be the result of the hands imitating a chopping motion while playing. The simplicity of the song and its title belie their somewhat obscure and intriguing history. For example, Arthur de Lulli is actually a pseudonym for Euphemia Allen -- who was only 16 years old when she allegedly composed the waltz. Though no other version of the song was published prior to 1877, in the same year, the daughter of Russian composer Alexander Borodin introduced her father to a nearly identical tune, but one with a different time signature (in other words, it was the same tune, but did not have the same rhythm as a waltz). Some have speculated that perhaps there is a common source of both Allen's and Borodin's songs -- but no real proof of this theory has yet been discovered.

As they grow, slash pines quickly lose their lower branches and the bark of the trunk becomes 1 to 2 inches thick. The tree's dense, hard wood offers protection against wildfires and also makes the tree extremely resistant to termites. The pine's cones are 2 to 6 inches long. The tree's needles range from 8 to 12 inches long and grow in clusters of two or three, adorning the ends of branches. The pine's tap root runs deeper than many pines, providing some protection against dry spells. Wildlife such as squirrels appreciate feasting on its pine seeds. Commercial products that come from slash pines include turpentine, rosin, and timber.

The snake lived approximately 58 million years ago deep within the hot and humid tropical forest of South America. Analysis of ancient fossilized tropical leaves indicates that the mean temperature in that earliest of known rain forests was around 82 degrees or higher. Some scientists believe that snakes can grow larger in warmer locations where they can absorb the energy needed to maintain their metabolic rate, which is critical for cold-blooded species. Many consider this a key factor in the size of the Titanoboa. A monster among carnivores, Titanoboa likely was capable of swallowing giant turtles and primitive crocodiles. Though their skulls are somewhat different, scientists believe modern day boa constrictors might be related to these extinct gargantuan creatures.

It had a brain approximately the size of a lime -- contrary to the walnut size earlier believed. A 19th century paleontologist observed a unique, enlarged cavity near the spinal cord in its hip area -- a space larger than its brain cavity -- and proposed an explanation for how such a small brain might control the large animal. He suggested that Stegosaurus possessed a secondary ""posterior braincase"" in this cavity. Theoretically, the tissue that filled that space might have functioned like a brain, helping the animal move more easily by sending signals more quickly to the dinosaur's main brain. Some modern species do indeed have more nervous system tissue near their limbs, which requires enlarged neural canal spaces. However, that type of space is distinct from the cavity in Stegosaurus, which modern paleontologists now know was not occupied by nerves and whose purpose is still in question.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about Stegosaurus is correct?

I saw that some of the trees had birds in them -- honeycreepers seeking nectar from the stunning pompom-like blossoms. The trees are legendary incarnations of a fabled young Hawaiian couple, Ohi''a and Lehua. According to the Hawaiian tale, Pele, the goddess of volcanos, loved handsome Ohi''a, but Ohi''a adored his wife Lehua. In jealousy, Pele used her power to transform Ohi''a into a twisted tree, thus separating him forever from his beloved. But sympathetic gods reunited the heartbroken Lehua with Ohi''a by changing her into the tree's crimson flowers. It is said that picking blossoms from the ohi''a lehua trees will bring rain, because of the sorrow Lehua feels when she is apart from her dear Ohi''a.

A child can scare it with a stick, but a disabled man may dread its attack. Alone it has the habit of a hare; but in packs -- and it hunts only in packs -- its poltroonery is less observable; sometimes under the influence of extreme hunger giving place to a savageness of disposition that assumes the semblance of courage. It is the coyotes' cunning that is most to be feared; and it was this that had begun to excite fresh apprehension in the mind of the mustanger.

He began singing with Tommy Dorsey's orchestra in the early 1940s, and after two years of hits, Sinatra struck out on his own. Going solo was the first milestone in what would be a string of successful career moves. From 1943 to 1946, Sinatra had many hit songs, and this period also included Sinatra's acting debut in the movie Higher and Higher. In the postwar years, Sinatra's popularity fell, and he lost his recording and film contracts. His luck soon changed when, in 1953, Sinatra won an acting award for From Here to Eternity and also signed a recording contract. When his record sales fell in the late 1950s, Sinatra started his own music label. In the mid-1960s, Sinatra became a main attraction on the Las Vegas strip. After a brief retirement in the early 1970s, Sinatra returned once again with the album Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back.

The author's main point in discussing Frank Sinatra is that

A.	he won many awards throughout his career.
B.	his career was defined by numerous rebirths.
C.	his career involved acting in addition to singing.
D.	he found his greatest success at the end of his career.

The festival's youthful organizers (the oldest was only 27 years old at the time of the event) planned a rock concert for 50,000 people. However, the day before the event was scheduled to begin, more than the expected number were already waiting on the concert field. Within days, an estimated 500,000 people converged on the festival, while thousands more were turned away by the police. Unfortunately, most of the audience had left by Monday morning, missing Jimi Hendrix's visionary interpretation of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" -- a patriotic ballad transformed into a counterculture anthem. The festival wasn't televised, and for the millions who weren't there, watching the documentary film about Woodstock released in 1970 was the next best thing. For decades, the movie has contributed to the mythology of the 1960s generation, and Woodstock is considered by many to represent a cultural shifting point in the United States.

Based on the passage, what is the author's main point about the Woodstock Festival?

A.	The event's youthful organizers were clearly overwhelmed.
B.	The event's most powerful performance was mostly unseen.

Immortalized by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem ""Paul Revere's Ride,"" American revolutionary Paul Revere became a folk hero for trying to deliver on horseback the news of an impending British invasion. However, Revere's contributions to the young republic are far more extensive than what is described in Longfellow's poem. Some of Revere's many roles included engraver of propaganda materials, leader of a ring of spies known as the mechanics, manufacturer of weapons for the Continental Army, and printer of money for the State of Massachusetts. After the American Revolution, Revere applied his business and technical skills to open the country's first copper-rolling mill, which provided copper sheeting for the hull of the U.S.S. Constitution. Revere's accomplishments were as varied as they were numerous.

In the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to

The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out. The big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.

Harvesting these kernels was no easy task, however, because only about 6 to 12 kernels grew in two rows on each seed spike, and each kernel was encased in a hard shell. But year after year, these clever farmers kept selecting and propagating the seeds from plants with desirable traits: those with the most kernels per seed spike, those with the best flavor, and those with a mutation that produced kernels without shells. After many centuries, these Central Americans had developed maize; in the United States, we call it corn. The transformation of Teosinte into corn represents perhaps the most impressive feat of genetic modification ever achieved by mankind. Now the world's largest production crop, corn is entirely dependent on human cultivation, and does not grow wild anywhere on Earth.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	argue that mutations in plants are desirable or advantageous.

For months before I left the comfort of my home to see the landmark structure, I viewed videos of the Great Wall, read history books with hand-rendered illustrations of its construction, and searched countless Web pages for tourists' own visions of the grandeur of this site. I devoured pages of text devoted to communicating its symmetry and expanse, its historical importance and military function. I studied its architectural noteworthiness, and its references in Chinese literature. I debated which part of the wall to explore: the closest section, which would also be the most crowded? Or the most breathtaking section, literally, which clings to steep hillsides but might be closed for reconstruction? When I finally arrived at my long sought destination, the reality of touching, standing, and walking on the Great Wall itself transcended my expectations and confirmed the limitations inherent in language and the impressions of others.

Boris looked round, and Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch. The place was almost deserted. It was a cul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed that way. The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy's imagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the steps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap sharply, with a peculiar rhythm, on the door.

It is commonly found in raw food products that come from animals, but thorough cooking and processing effectively kills salmonella. In the case of my friend, I suspect the salmonella infection was acquired from consuming a piece of undercooked chicken at a restaurant. I'm now feeling cautious about eating at restaurants. For preparing food at home, I have purchased a meat thermometer to make sure everything I cook is at the proper temperature. In my kitchen, food safety guidelines are strictly followed. Before I cook, I thoroughly clean the surfaces of all food preparation areas; after meals, leftovers are promptly chilled. It's important to pay as much attention to cleaning as to cooking.

In looking for ways to help her, I found some strategies that have made a difference. In her room, I created a reading nook. It wasn't hard to do; I bought a large beanbag and placed it in a corner of her room with a sign designating the space as her own private reading nook -- a special space dedicated for reading. She loved it, and soon found reading to be a pleasant and rewarding experience. Also, I didn't judge her choice of reading materials. As long as she was choosing age-appropriate reading, I let her read it. These two small changes have boosted the time my daughter spends reading.

Another extraordinary fallacy is the dread of night air. What air can we breathe at night but night air? The choice is between pure night air from without and foul night air from within. Most people prefer the latter. An unaccountable choice. What will they say if it is proved to be true that fully one-half of all the disease we suffer from is occasioned by people sleeping with their windows shut? An open window most nights in the year can never hurt anyone. This is not to say that light is not necessary for recovery. In great cities, night air is often the best and purest air to be had in the twenty-four hours.

Cheap tea contains sawdust, dried and powdered hay, grass-seed, and departed but unlamented insects. Moral -- buy good tea, or go without. Have the kettle boiling, and take the water at the first boil. Scald out the tea-pot, which must never be of metal, and put into it one teaspoonful of tea for each person, and one for the pot, or more, if curly hair for the drinker is desired. Pour one cupful of boiling water for each person and another for the pot upon the tea, and pour off the tea inside of three minutes. After that the boiling water busies itself in taking tannic acid out of the tea grounds. Tannic acid hardens albumen into a leathery substance of which the most courageous stomach is rightfully suspicious, and also puckers the mucous membrane of the stomach into smocking. Persistent drinking of boiled tea is quite likely to relieve the stomach altogether of its valued and hard-worked mucous membrane.

The chief reason for the dryness of the Great Basin is the presence of that lofty barrier, the Sierra Nevada mountain range, between the Basin and the Pacific Ocean. The storms, which usually come from the ocean, are intercepted by this range, and the greater portion of their moisture is taken away. The little moisture that remains falls upon the highlands of the Great Basin, and so relieves its surface from utter barrenness. The adjacent slopes of the Sierra Nevada and Wasatch ranges furnish numerous perennial streams which feed the lakes about the borders of the Basin …. The wet weather streams, flowing down the desert mountains for a short time each year, frequently form broad, shallow lakes which disappear with the coming of the summer sun.

According to the passage, the dryness of the Great Basin results from the

Some complain that fresh produce is too expensive, but affordable fruits and vegetables can be found by keeping the following in mind: look online or in your local paper for sales, specials, or coupons for the items you want to buy. If relevant, try to buy in bulk. For example, a bag of apples may be cheaper than buying them individually. Grocery stores may not be your only option. Try your local farmers' market; produce at such markets is often less expensive because it is local and seasonal. But, if your only choice is the grocery store, cut costs by buying only seasonal vegetables. Finally, if you have space for a garden or access to a community garden, try growing some of your own produce.

Construction began in 1901 where Broadway intersects 5th Avenue at a sharp angle. A year later, their wedge-shaped tower was finished. Unlike other skyscrapers resembling a tall box resting atop shorter, wider boxes, Burnham's design was a single tall shaft. Only about six feet wide at its narrowest edge (an acute angle of about 25 degrees), it was dubbed the ""Flatiron Building.""

Zeke was getting old, so Sanjay decided, without being entirely sure if it was a good idea, to get another cat. He adopted an orange cat with white paws that he named Boots. Boots was big and playful and always preferred Sanjay's company to being alone. About a month after Boots was adopted, Sanjay found a stray cat in his backyard that had a wounded paw -- a black cat with amber eyes. Worried about the cat, Sanjay brought it inside and nursed it back to health while calling local animal shelters to see if anyone was missing it. No one was, so he kept it and gave it the name, Pepper. Three cats were a lot for Sanjay, but he was adjusting when out of the blue his sister called telling him that his niece Belle had developed a severe allergy to their cat, Finley! Amara begged Sanjay to take the cat -- to keep it in the family. How could he say no? Besides, Finley, a Russian Blue, had the most beautiful grey fur, and bright green eyes, his favorite colors.

According to the passage, what color is the injured cat?

In 1938, when she was just sixteen, she entered university. Upon graduating in 1941 she was awarded a scholarship for a further year of research. In 1942, with World War II still on, she had to decide whether to be drafted for more traditional war work or pursue a doctorate in a field relevant to wartime needs. She chose the latter and her work during this time yielded a Ph.D. in 1945. Franklin's scientific achievements, both in coal chemistry and virus structure research were considerable. However, it is her role in the discovery of DNA structure that has garnered the most public attention. Crick, Watson, and Wilkins shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for their work on the structure of DNA. None gave Franklin credit for her contributions. In 1975, Franklin's friend Anne Sayre published a biography and Franklin's role in the discovery became better known.

Upon hearing Colter's description, people assumed it to be a tall tale and jokingly referred to it as ""Colter's Hell."" Eventually, other explorers and prospectors journeyed into the area. In 1871, Ferdinand Hayden, head of the U.S. Geological Survey of the Territories, organized an expedition, which included a botanist, zoologist, meteorologist, and several topographers, to collect scientific data. The team also included the pioneering photographer William Jackson, who created a visual record of the expedition. With visual proof of Yellowstone's wonders, congress moved to set aside over one million acres of public land. In 1872, President Grant signed the Yellowstone Act into law, establishing the area as America's first national park.

Your choice may depend on your timetable. Some varieties can produce tomatoes about eight weeks after the seedlings have been planted, while others can take nearly three months. As the plants are growing, there are techniques to improve your harvest. For example, pinch off any new growth that develops where the plant has formed two branches; known as suckers, these branches won't bear fruit. When thinking about what kind of harvest you want, you might want to consider growing either determinate tomato varieties or indeterminate varieties. If you want your harvest to occur during a short window of time, say for the purposes of canning, then grow a determinate variety. If, however, you want to harvest them until the first frost, then plant indeterminate varieties. No matter what you choose for whatever purpose, though, you can't go wrong because nothing beats the taste of home-grown tomatoes.

According to the passage, indeterminate plants produce tomatoes

A.	for a two-week period.
B.	only if the suckers are pinched.

In any case, no fewer than five different kinds of fish should be included. In Marseille, the home of the recipe, seven kinds of fish are used, to which shellfish are added. Their traditional recipe also includes olive oil, tomato, garlic, onion, parsley, thyme, fennel, saffron, bay leaves, and orange peels. Requiring only about an hour of preparation time, bouillabaisse uses all parts of the fish. You begin with making a bouillon by roasting the fish bones, heads, and shells in a stockpot with olive oil, tomatoes, onions, and fennel. After these are caramelized, strain out the solids, bring the bouillon to a simmer, and add the remaining ingredients and chunks of fish. Serve hot with toasted baguettes for sopping up the juices.

Mr. Hartright, you have thoughtlessly allowed yourself to form an attachment … to my sister Laura. I don't put you to the pain of confessing it in so many words, because I see and know that you are too honest to deny it. I don't even blame you -- I pity you for opening your heart to a hopeless affection. You have not attempted to take any underhand advantage -- you have not spoken to my sister in secret. You are guilty of weakness and want of attention to your own best interests, but of nothing worse. If you had acted, in any single respect, less delicately and less modestly, I should have told you to leave the house without an instant's notice, or an instant's consultation of anybody. As it is, I blame the misfortune of your years and your position -- I don't blame you.

Since Vic and Eric were experienced skiers they had insisted upon being the trail breakers. It would be fun, they had said, to forge on ahead of the others, open the cabins, kindle the fires and have them burning lustily when the rest of the party arrived. It was fun, too, at first, even after the storm had begun. The snowfall had been gentle then, giving no warning that it was to increase beyond all natural expectations. When it did, the falling snow soon had become so thick as to obscure outstanding landmarks. Even the smooth, narrow ski tracks were obliterated almost as fast as they were made, and Vic and Eric were now so far ahead that their trail-breaking was of little use to the others. But a fresh blaze on a tree trunk, appearing every now and then well above all possible height of drifting snow, assured the couple they were following a trail.

The rat was discovered by a group of filmmakers and scientists making a movie about an isolated rainforest in Papua New Guinea. The name of the rat comes from the location where it was discovered -- in the crater of the extinct volcano, Mount Bosavi. So, what makes this rat more interesting to me than other rats? It's huge! From head to tail, it's nearly 3 feet long and can weigh over 3 pounds. The rat's discoverers described it as quite tame (has no fear of humans) and it lives on a vegetarian diet. One of the scientists said it looked to be about the size of his cat. It occurred to me that the Bosavi rat might make a great pet. However, even though I'd like it as a pet, it really belongs in the rainforest. In fact, I hope the only place I ever see one is if I were to visit the area of Mount Bosavi. Such amazing creatures should stay in their natural habitat. For now, I shall be content to look at pictures and video online.

Much wood is used in decoration and furniture, where appearance, appropriateness, and finish are called for; but these woods, although much in evidence, are infinitely less in quantity than those employed in construction. Some wood is required for implements, turnery, carvings, and small-piece work, where size is secondary and where qualities such as hardness, fine grain, and uniformity, controllable in small pieces, are primary. Some wood is used indirectly, as in the manufacture of paper-pulp, gunpowder, and chemicals. There are also by-products of trees, such as tanbark, turpentine, resin, nuts, and sugar.

Working in mines, scrabbling among rocks, driving mules, and setting timber support shafts, laborers needed durable clothing. It was all too common, however, for work pants to tear at the pockets and points of stress. Jacob Davis, a tailor in Reno, Nevada, began using copper rivets to strengthen highly stressed seams. His customers were pleased, and Davis felt he should patent his idea. The fee, however, for a patent application was $69, an amount Davis didn't have. Consequently, he invited his denim supplier, Levi Strauss, a San Francisco merchant, to join him in the venture. On May 20, 1873, Davis and Strauss were awarded U.S. Patent #139,121 for ""an improvement in Fastening Pocket-Openings.""

Her book, Silent Spring, published in 1962, awakened society to an awareness of its responsibility to other forms of life. In the book, Carson warned of the dangers of chemical pesticides, but she was also aware of the controversy within the agricultural community, which depended on pesticide use to increase crop production. After publication, Silent Spring provoked a firestorm of controversy as well as personal attacks on Carson's professional integrity. The pesticide industry mounted a campaign to discredit her. The federal government, however, ordered a complete review of pesticide policy and Carson was asked to testify before a congressional committee. As a direct result of that review, the harmful chemical pesticide DDT was banned.

Benjamin Franklin is often credited with originating its idea; in a whimsical essay, Franklin championed the thrift of using fewer candles by getting up earlier to make better use of morning light, and then going to bed earlier in the evening. In 1895, the idea that was whimsical for Franklin was taken seriously by insect scientist George Vernon Hudson when he proposed a plan for initiating daylight savings time to the Wellington Philosophical Society in New Zealand. Hudson proposed a two-hour shift forward in October, and in March, a two-hour shift back. About ten years later, William Willett authored a pamphlet that proposed moving the clocks forward twenty minutes each week in April. In 1908, the British parliament considered the idea but it failed to pass. About a decade later, Austria and Germany became the first countries to adopt the shift in hours to save daylight. Eventually, dozens of other countries followed, including the United States in 1918.

The problem with harpsichords, however, was that the loudness of the sound was always the same; they could only be played at the same volume each time. But around 1700 in Florence, Italy, a harpsichord maker named Bartolomeo Cristofori, who was employed as the ""keeper of instruments"" in the court of Prince Ferdinand de Medici, had an idea for improving the harpsichord. Instead of using tiny pics that plucked the strings, as all harpsichords do, Cristofori's new instrument used hammers that hit the strings. He called it the pianoforte, meaning soft/loud. Depending on the musician's touch, the ability to adjust the volume of the sound meant the pianoforte could be played with great expressiveness. It was a technical and musical breakthrough. Before he died in 1731 at the age of 75, Cristofori built 20 pianofortes; three of his original instruments are still in existence.

This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a ""starter,"" as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.

Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or -- in this place at least -- to much of any description. My object here is simply to project the draft of a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.

The first modern idea about the moon's formation is known as the fission theory, proposed by George Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin. The fission theory suggests that the moon broke away from a young Earth when it was still a rapidly rotating ball of molten rock. Another theory supposes that the earth and the moon formed at the same time, both condensing from the original nebula that formed our solar system. The capture theory suggests that the earth's gravitation captured the passing moon, which had formed elsewhere. The giant impact hypothesis, a widely accepted argument, posits that the moon was formed when an object the size of Mars crashed into Earth, spewing pieces of our young planet's crust out into space; gravity eventually bound them together, forming the Moon.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	expose the lack of evidence for the capture theory.

Although there's no practical way to eliminate all mold indoors, you can control mold growth by controlling moisture and humidity. For example, if a building has a water leak or other water problem, fixing the source of it will help prevent mold growth. If you do discover mold, clean it off hard surfaces with water and detergent and then let the cleaned area dry completely. If there are molds on absorbent materials, these materials may need to be replaced. Other ways to control molds include preventing condensation by adding insulation to a building; not installing carpeting in areas where there is a moisture problem; and ventilating shower, laundry, and cooking areas.

According to the passage, if molds are on absorbent materials, those materials may need to be

According to experts, adult houseflies usually live fifteen to twenty-five days and may even live up to two months. The fly's life cycle begins when adult females deposit eggs in rotting organic matter. After approximately twelve hours, they hatch, and these larvae, or maggots, feed on the matter around them. A maggot passes through three larval stages before forming a pupa, or cocoon, from which the adult fly emerges. This development from egg to adult typically occurs within ten days. Add together these ten days and the fifteen to twenty-five days of life as an adult, and you end up with a life span of a lot more than twenty-four hours!

The ""jet"" in ""jet black"" refers to a gemstone formed from the fossilization of wood under extreme pressure. Ancient Romans and Greeks valued jet, and this gemstone was especially popular in mid-19th century England during Queen Victoria's reign. Jet was worn in the belief that it could ward off evil and also as a symbol of mourning. It has not been as popular in modern times, even though black remains a stylish color for gemstones. Instead, onyx and tourmaline have replaced jet in popularity, and these gemstones are both abundant and inexpensive. Now, if you ever hear something called ""jet black,"" you'll know it has nothing to do with airplanes and everything to do with gemstones.

A patch kit from the bike shop should have all the supplies you need. First, you have to take your wheel off. Use a socket wrench to loosen the bolt on the wheel. Next, you have to find the damage that caused the flat tire. Inside the tough outer tire, there is an inflatable inner tube, which is where the damage usually occurs. Take the tire off the wheel and inspect the inner tube. You may see a hole or hear air hissing out of the tube. Once you find the hole, you have to patch it by removing the tube. Clean the area around the hole, apply glue, and firmly place a patch onto the area. After applying the patch and letting the glue dry, inflate the tube slightly to ensure that it holds air. Finally, you can put the tube back in the tire, reattach the wheel to the bike, and finish inflating the tire.

I, too, can work, and because I love to labor with my head and my hands, I am an optimist in spite of all. I used to think I should be thwarted in my desire to do something useful. But I have found out that though the ways in which I can make myself useful are few, yet the work open to me is endless. … Darwin could work only half an hour at a time; yet in many diligent half-hours he laid anew the foundations of philosophy. I long to accomplish a great and noble task; but it is my chief duty and joy to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble. It is my service to think how I can best fulfil the demands that each day makes upon me, and to rejoice that others can do what I cannot.

As the rays of moonlight seem to pierce the air like arrows, Diana, like Apollo, was said to carry a quiver of darts; the slender arc of the crescent moon was her bow. Thence it was natural to consider her fond of hunting, and she became the special patroness of the chase and other sylvan sports. Her favorite haunts were groves and lakes, and she blessed the increase of field and meadow.

Secondly, apparently when I'm hot, I completely lose my appetite. I would rather sit around not moving except to drink cold water, rather than have to prepare a meal. Preparing something simple, like a salad, wasn't worth the effort. Thirdly, when I finally was in air conditioning, it seemed too cold.

From a young age, his proclivity for building and fixing mechanical items was apparent; he learned to fix watches and to build basic water wheels and steam engines. Leaving home at 16, Ford went to Detroit and worked as an apprentice for a manufacturer of railroad cars. Eager to gain as much mechanical knowledge as possible, he held several positions there. Several years later, while serving as the chief engineer of the Illuminating Company, Ford built his first car, referred to as a ""horseless carriage."" It was not until he built his second car, two years later, that he succeeded in convincing others to invest in his idea--a company that would make and sell cars.

Until that time, information was exchanged at the speed of a sailing ship or a galloping horse. During the 1830s and 1840s, inventors working independently in several countries developed workable electric telegraphs, and these devices quickly superseded other technologies with the same name. By the mid-19th century, telegraphy had acquired its present definition as a device for transmitting messages by electric impulses that traveled instantaneously by wire to distant receivers, where they were interpreted into readable text. European foreign ministries first used telegraphy during the early 1850s, but it did not become an important tool in the diplomacy of the United States until the completion of a successful transatlantic cable in 1866.

The larger the world's phytoplankton population, the more carbon dioxide gets pulled from the atmosphere. Less carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, means lower average temperatures. Scientists have found that a given population of phytoplankton can double its numbers about once per day. In other words, phytoplankton respond very rapidly to changes in their environment. Large populations of them, sustained over long periods of time, might significantly lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and, in turn, lower average temperatures. The understanding and monitoring of phytoplankton can help scientists study and predict environmental change.

It meant that the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) would soon remove its tracks and terminal from the National Mall. But more importantly, plans to bring all the city's railroads under one roof promised that Washington would finally have a station large enough to handle large crowds and would be impressive enough to reflect the growing importance of the United States and its capital. Architects Daniel Burnham and Peirce Anderson conveyed this message in their station design by using neoclassical elements that connected Washington to Athens and Rome; a massive scale, including a facade stretching more than 600 feet and a waiting room ceiling 96 feet above the floor; expensive materials such as marble, gold leaf, and granite from a previously unused quarry; and an orientation that faced their building towards the U.S. Capitol, just five blocks away.

The trees in a forest are all helped by mutually protecting each other against high winds, and by producing a richer and moister soil than would be possible if the trees stood singly and apart. They compete among themselves by their roots for moisture in the soil, and for light and space by the growth of their crowns in height and breadth. Perhaps the strongest weapon which trees have against each other is growth in height. In certain species intolerant of shade, the tree which is overtopped has lost the race for good. The number of young trees which destroy each other in this fierce struggle for existence is prodigious, so that often a few score per acre are all that survive to middle or old age out of many tens of thousands of seedlings which entered the race of life on approximately even terms.

1605.	Embracing multiple techniques from a recent painting class, I created my most original work of art ever. Starting with a mop, I spread a pale blue shade over a massive sheet of heavy watercolor paper, then sprinkled salt crystals across the surface to achieve a unique background texture. Relying on gravity, I next used various sizes of brushes and dripped primary colors in random locations to produce a diverse assortment of blobs. A small cotton rag, which I squished into a ball, became a tool for spreading out the drips and varying the intensity of their color. After a drying period, I stepped out of my comfort zone and applied an accent paint color to my hair. I became one with the painting, using my dripping locks to smear bands of movement and energy across the page. Lastly, in the lower right corner of the page, I sealed my masterpiece with a unique signature.

For instance, if a town committee wishes to erect a statue to its local hero in the public square, and if on two opposite sides of the square there are buildings of very different heights, the statue should not be put in the exact middle of the square, if it is to give the best effect from a distance. It should be placed a little toward the smaller building. A colleague of the writer found, when this was first made public, that the pictures in his house had actually been hung in such a way as to allow for this illusion. Whenever a picture was to be put up between two others of considerable difference of size, or between a door (large) and a window (small), it had actually been hung a little nearer to the smaller -- toward the small picture or toward the window -- and not in the true middle.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

Psychology is the science of the mind. It aims to find out all about the mind -- the whole story -- just as the other sciences aim to find out all about the subjects of which they treat -- astronomy, of the stars; geology, of the earth; physiology, of the body. And when we wish to trace out the story of the mind, as psychology has done it, we find that there are certain general truths with which we should first acquaint ourselves; truths which the science has been a very long time finding out, but which we can now realize without a great deal of explanation. These general truths, we may say, are preliminary to the story itself; they deal rather with the need of defining, first of all, the subject or topic of which the story is to be told.

If you put the cream in a can, or other vessel containing cream that was skimmed some hours previous, be sure to stir it all well together, so that it may be of the same consistency. Keep the cream at a temperature of 62 to 68 degrees until it becomes slightly sour, when it is ready for churning. I have churned very sweet cream and very sour cream, but have never been able to get butter of good flavor from anything but slightly soured cream. I am also of the opinion that butter made from cream only slightly sour will keep much longer than when made from a very sweet or sour cream. I am often asked if I think that straining the cream is an advantage, and I will answer by saying that I do think it aids somewhat in helping the butter to come more evenly.

Gaining membership required her to find two members who agreed to be her sponsors, which she did after many rejections. Siebert was by then familiar with the challenges to women in her chosen profession, as she had already experienced gender discrimination both in hiring and in pay in her first securities analyst jobs. Siebert's NYSE membership paved the way for her to found a financial firm in her name. Within a decade, she entered government by accepting an appointment as the first female superintendent of banking for the state of New York. Next, she sought the Republican nomination for a seat in the United States Senate, but was unsuccessful.

Since then, I've learned there are others -- in Death Valley (Nevada and California), Argentina, and Bolivia. I didn't really know much about a salt plain except what I experienced myself -- that it was a flat, desert area, covered with a crusty layer of whitish salt and other minerals as far as my eyes could see. It looks like you are walking on a never-ending snow-covered plain. The largest salt flat in the world, called Salar de Uyuni, is in Bolivia. I've never been there, but I recently visited one in nearby Argentina, called Salinas Grandes, where artists carve llamas and other animal shapes from the salt for you to buy. One of the largest protected salt flats is in Death Valley, in an area called Badwater Basin. I've visited this place too and remember it because the salt flat there seemed thinner, more fragile, and more in need of protection than the others.

The city of Chicago quickly rebuilt, and within a couple of years residents memorialized the anniversary of the fire with festivities. The Fire Marshals Association of North America (FMA), the oldest membership section of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), decided that the 40th anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire should be observed not with festivities, but in a way that would keep the public informed about the importance of fire prevention. When President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed the first NFPW in 1925, he noted that in the previous year some 15,000 lives were lost to fire in the United States. The NFPA continues today to make National Fire Prevention Week a priority and counts on the participation and efforts of tens of thousands of fire and safety professionals, emergency volunteers, and other individuals working to reduce the risk of fire and the toll it takes on society.

This is our third day and we are leaving Montpellier, having passed from Aix to Arles, Tarascon, and Nimes, and thence here, and have had but one mishap, not at all our fault. In a long, straight stretch of the Corniche, between Nice and Cannes, two men were walking away from us and we fortunately were not moving at high speed. Our horn was blown constantly and there were no other machines in sight. One of the men, knowing we should follow the law of the land and pass him on his left, kept his side of the road, but the other completely lost his head, and dodging from one side to the other like a chicken, forced us either to run over him or into the ditch. Of course we did the latter. Jean managed the auto so well that no injury was done, as the ditch was but a few inches deep, but then came the problem, how to get out.

As we approach the latter place, a turn in the road brings in view a magnificent mansion, part castle and part palace. As it rises majestically on its terrace above the river it resembles Linlithgow, is as stately as Rheinfels, and, like both, is all in ruins. An old peasant on the highway tells us that many visitors go there and so Jean turns the auto into a shady lane and drives past some old cottages… . It is the property of the Ducs de Gramont, though they seldom come here.

Although the General was known for being a formidable leader, he had little to do with the origins of his namesake dish. In fact, while there are competing theories regarding the recipe's inventor -- complicated further by the many variations of the recipe -- most agree that General Tso's chicken was little known in China until after it was already a popular dish in the United States. The American popularization of the dish occurred no later than the 1970s but, depending on which of many theories one believes about its origins, could have begun any time after World War II. Thus, it is highly unlikely that General Tso himself, who passed away in 1885, tasted the dish as we know it today. In fact, even though the dish enjoys a great international reputation, it is virtually unknown in the Hunan province of China.

The main incidents of Rossini's life are all connected directly or indirectly with music. As a youth, when Prince Eugene was Viceroy of Italy, he would have fallen a victim to the conscription but for the proofs he had already given of rare musical genius. At the age of 30 he married a singer for whom he had written some of his greatest parts. As a young man he was constantly travelling from one Italian city to another to superintend the production of his works. For the same reason he went to Vienna, just as his Italian career was coming to an end, and there met Beethoven. He never crossed the sea but once, and then only the Straits of Dover, to pay an artistic visit to England; and he passed the latter portion of his life in the country to which he had given ""William Tell,"" and which he had almost adopted as his own.

Melt in a pan a lump of butter the size of a tangerine orange and squeeze on it the juice of half a lemon. The way to get a great deal of juice from a lemon is to plunge it first of all for a few minutes, say five minutes, in boiling water. When the butter simmers, throw in a pound of picked small mushrooms, stir them constantly, do not let them get black. Then in three or four minutes they are well impregnated with butter, and the chief difficulty of the dish is over. Put the saucepan further on the fire, let it boil for a few minutes. Take out the mushrooms, drain them, sprinkle them with flour, moisten them with gravy, season with salt and pepper, put them back in the butter and stir in the yolk of an egg. Add also a little of the lemon juice that remains. While you are doing this you must get another person to cut and toast some bread and to butter it.

First, squeeze into a measuring cup as much of the juice as possible from several lemons. Measure and then add an equal amount of very cold water to the cup. Next, stir in a teaspoon of baking soda. Before adding sugar, taste the drink. Depending on your preference for sweetness, add only as much sugar as needed to make the drink just right. You should now have a bubbly, tasty glass of lemonade. If you're wondering why the drink fizzes, it's because baking soda is an alkaline and lemon juice is an acid. When the two ingredients are combined, an acid-base reaction occurs. The reaction gives off carbon dioxide, which produces bubbles and adds the ""fizz"" to your yummy lemonade drink.

What may not be known is that during an eruption, volcanic gases are also emitted. Some of these volcanic gases may be harmful to people as well as to the ecosystem in general. For example, large eruptions that release great volumes of sulfur gases may result in acid rain or reduce the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere. Another gas, carbon dioxide, is safe if very diluted, but may settle in the soil of low-lying areas and reach levels that can be deadly to animals, plants, and people. Hydrogen fluoride, which can combine with tiny ash particles and land on plants and in water, can cause irritation to the eyes or even have lethal results if ingested. Fortunately, the greatest percentage of all volcanic gas emitted is actually just water vapor, resulting from the heating of underground water.

In discussing volcanic eruptions, the author's primary focus is on the

A great painting presents itself as a completed whole before the observer's eye. It holds on the canvas the fixed place given it by the master from whose genius it proceeded. No intermediary force is needed to come between it and the impression it makes on the beholder. Music, on the contrary, must be aroused from the written, or printed page to living tone by the hand or voice of the interpreter, and but a fragment at a time can be made perceptible to the listener's ear. Like a panorama, it comes and goes before the imagination, its kaleidoscopic tints and forms now sharply contrasted, now almost imperceptibly graduated one into the other, but all shaping themselves into a logical union, stamped with the design of a creative mind. Properly to inspect the successive musical images, and grasp their significance, in parts and as a whole, demands keen mental alertness.

Another easy but important type of preventive maintenance is tire rotation. Although tires are as essential to a car's functioning as its engine, tire rotation, for some reason, often gets overlooked. Not only does performing this simple procedure extend the life of the tires, it actually increases safe driving. Front tires, because they steer the car, always wear out more quickly than rear tires. Rotating the tires regularly equalizes tread wear, thereby decreasing road noise and vibrations. It also leads to improved gas mileage. Tire rotation prolongs the life of the vehicle's suspension components, as well. Although it's a good rule of thumb to rotate your tires as frequently as you change your oil, check your owner's manual to find specific recommended timeframes.

In discussing tire rotation, the author's primary focus is on

In 1874, a few years after Eakins had returned from France and about the time that he was working out his method of perspective, the word Impressionists was coined to fit those artists who were trying to catch the instantaneous impression of variously reflected points of light. Eakins was more enchanted with the marvels of human anatomy than with reflections on a lily pond, more enchanted with the sweep of a boat in motion than with the iridescence of a cathedral seen through snow. But like the impressionists he was aware of an inner necessity to picture things as they truly seem to the two eyes of man. To Monet the solution was the skillful catching of reflections that changed with a moment of time; to Eakins the solution was found in a perspective that corrected the distortion of photography and reduced to a minimum the necessity of depending on estimated dimensions.

Clouds are often grouped into four categories, three of which are based on their position in the earth's atmosphere (low, middle, and high), while the fourth is characterized by the presence of vertical development. Low clouds, such as stratus, occur after fog has lifted, and are not usually associated with significant precipitation. Middle clouds, like altocumulus, typically roll in on humid days, and allude to possible thunderstorms later in the afternoon. Cirrus clouds, on the other hand, are often a sign of fair weather and reside high in the atmosphere. Clouds with vertical development, such as cumulonimbus, do not adhere to a specific elevation but are instead distinguished by their towering forms, which warn of possible thunderstorms and even tornadoes. So if you're ever interested in predicting the weather, spend some time looking at the clouds.

These violins, which have been known to sell for millions of dollars, are the creations of Italian craftsman Antonio Stradivari, who constructed them between the years 1677 and 1727. Though it is difficult to definitively identify what makes these particular instruments superior to their counterparts, many claim their value lies in unparalleled sound quality and craftsmanship. The much-praised resonance of Stradivarius violins has been linked to the body style, which is shallower than most designs, and the incredibly thin structure, which not only contributes to the characteristic tone of the instrument, but also results in a lighter product. It is also said that Stradivari perfected the varnish of the wood on his pieces, which may play a part in the sound as well.

Characterized by its large size and slow growth, the saguaro is well equipped to handle the harsh weather and lack of water found in its indigenous habitats, and is an essential part of the local ecosystem. Often reaching heights of 40 feet or more, the saguaro also has a thick waxy coating that protects it from losing precious water reserves stored within. Gila woodpeckers, a species of desert bird, survive by piercing the cactus' thick skin and building their nests within its cool, moist interior. Other animals use the cactus as a food source. Small pack rats and pocket mice nibble on its waxy skin, while bats and bees look for nourishment to the nectar producing flowers that bloom in the late spring and early summer.

Poetry, and especially the recitation of poetry, might be one of the most practical and important things you learn in school. For example, by understanding a character as it is written by others, one can practice empathy. Imagine the dramatic dimension of reading and performing the words of another or the words one has written for another to say. From this experience comes respect and concern for the intense mystery of any individual's life. It is no wonder research shows that literary participation correlates with responsible civic behaviors -- volunteering, charitable giving, voting.

The Line of Communication is the only thing which keeps an army going, which enables it to operate. If that be cut, the guns are silenced and the army starves. It is absolutely imperative to every advancing army that its rear, its Line of Communication, be safe from attack by the enemy. It is the artery which carries its life-blood. You can easily see that, for such an immense transportation work, control of the railways of a country is the first chief need of an invading army. No wagon system could provision an army or keep it supplied with munitions.

The teacher's task is not primarily the acquisition of knowledge, but the impartation of it, -- an entirely different matter. We teachers are forever taking thoughts out of our minds and putting them elsewhere. So long as we are content to keep them in our possession, we are not teachers at all. One who is interested in laying hold on wisdom is likely to become a scholar. And while no doubt it is well for a teacher to be a fair scholar, -- I have known several such, -- that is not the main thing. What constitutes the teacher is the passion to make scholars; and again and again it happens that the great scholar has no such passion whatever.

I am exactly like Father; because we understood each other, and because both of us always knew, although we never mentioned it; that Mother preferred my sister Eileen to me, Father tried to make it up to me, so from the time I can remember I was at his heels. It never bothered him to have me playing around in the library while he was writing his most complicated treatise. I have waited in his car half a day at a time, playing or reading, while he watched a patient or delivered a lecture at some medical college.

When I had taken three or four such steps, without encountering an obstacle, or, indeed, anything at all, I began, all at once, to wish I had not seen the house; that I had passed it by; that I had not come through the window; that I were safely out of it again. I became, on a sudden, aware, that something was with me in the room. There was nothing, ostensible, to lead me to such a conviction; it may be that my faculties were unnaturally keen; but, all at once, I knew that there was something there.

The sugaring season, which lasts roughly four to six weeks in early spring, starts when daytime temperatures begin to warm, but nighttime lows remain below freezing. Sap is extracted by tapping the tree with a device known as a spile. Each tap hole produces approximately 10 gallons of sap. Straight from the tree, the sap is clear, watery, and only slightly sweet. Once harvested, the liquid is processed in a building called a sugarhouse, where most of the water is evaporated leaving a mixture which contains roughly one-third water and two-thirds sugar. The original 10 gallons of sap will be reduced to approximately one quart of delicious maple syrup.

Based on the passage, maple syrup is

A.	collected from a tree using a spile.

To produce this colored effect, molten glass is combined with different types of powdered metal or metallic salts which ""stain"" the glass in a variety of tones and hues. These pieces are then assembled by placing lead strips, known as cames, between the forms and soldering the sections together. Reaching its greatest popularity in medieval Europe, stained glass became a staple in gothic churches and cathedrals, while its use became more common in homes much later, during the Renaissance era. Still produced today, stained glass is crafted in much the same way as it was centuries ago.

She was born in New York City in 1933, raised in various suburbs -- on Long Island, near Tucson, the San Fernando Valley -- and when she enrolled at university as a teenager, she felt she'd found home. She recalls standing in line and hearing Proust's name pronounced correctly for the first time. When she recounts this on video decades later, you can still see the ecstasy of that moment in her face. Nevertheless, she later transferred to another university, where she married a professor whom she'd only known for ten days. She had a child, won a philosophy fellowship in England, divorced; fell in and out of love … in Paris and New York; wrote novels, stage plays, and essays on subjects ranging from photography to illness to horror movies. She was brilliant, beautiful, and forceful. She established herself as a cultural critic and a public intellectual, and became excessively famous. By the time of her death -- of cancer, in 2004 -- she had left an enduring and sometimes controversial mark on American culture.

With the extraordinary facilities for travel available in modern times, it is a serious mistake in those who possess the means, not to become familiar with the various sections of the globe.

The latter, for instance, do not differ from the statistics which we have so often seen recorded, their great, dominating outlines are the same as pictorially delineated, but when we actually stand before them, they are touched by the wand of enchantment, and spring into visible life.

Color, remarks Ruskin, is wholly relative; each hue throughout a work is altered by every touch added in other places. Thus, to place white beside a color is to heighten its tone; to set black beside a color is to weaken its tone; while to put grey beside a color, is to render it more brilliant. If a dark color be placed near a different, but lighter color, the tone of the first is heightened, while that of the second is lowered. An important consequence of this principle is, that the first effect may neutralize the second, or even destroy it altogether. What was cold before, becomes warm when a colder color is set near it, and what was in harmony before, becomes discordant as other colors are put beside it.

What emerged was a new style of painting that avoided the contemporary emphasis on realistic renderings of nature and history that illustrated a moral, or taught a lesson. Instead, heavily influenced by the style of Japanese woodblock prints, Whistler created a new sort of picture, one that he hoped would be valued for its beauty and arrangement of color alone: art for art's sake. Prominent in this new phase of work was the series known as the Nocturnes. Set in and around the river Thames, including views of Battersea Bridge and nearby Cremorne Gardens, these oil paintings were moody, atmospheric, and dark, and often punctuated by a bright tumble of tiny dots meant to resemble fireworks exploding over the river. Human figures were blurred suggestions, shadows abounded, fog was a given. They were brooding, twilight-lit, and very beautiful.

Tolstoy has theories of art. Personally I am rather sorry for this, because if he did not have them he would be a greater artist. Even as theories of life often mar existence, so theories of art impair the artist. Admitting that art with a purpose can help the world, it is certain that art for its own sweet sake can create and re-create worlds. After he had contributed some of the greatest works of art to the literature of Russia, Tolstoy decided to find out just what art was. During his investigations, which lasted many years, he found that the art of the world was in great part lazy, unemployed, corrupt, suffering from ennui, and ministering to the debauched, poor rich people, whom the poor man ever envies; he decided that art should become useful and go to work, and he gave it an employment -- the promulgation of his ideas of social regeneration.

When George Washington surveyed this area of Virginia in 1749, he deemed it a ""fine improvable marsh,"" and, over the course of two centuries, the marsh was almost ""improved"" to death, with dikes (spelled ""dykes"" in Colonial times), croplands, and dredging for gravel. In 1959, an Act of Congress finally designated Dyke Marsh a wildlife preserve, ""so that fish and wildlife development and their preservation as wetland wildlife habitat shall be paramount."" In the decades since, the marsh and the swamp forest that lines it have been healing, slowly. Today, Dyke Marsh has some scrappy patches, the old wounds still visible. Still, there is something about the place.

She bought it because she read that she was supposed to walk a minimum of 10,000 steps per day. She measured it, and for her stride that was about 4 and a half miles! How would she find the time from her busy desk job to be able to meet that goal? She tried nevertheless and found that though it did take time out of her day, hitting that goal of 10,000 steps wasn't overly time consuming. For one thing, while she was at work, she made either more trips to different locations in her office building, or she took a longer route. For example, instead of using the restroom closest to her office, she used the one on the first floor. Instead of using the nearest kitchen, she used the one on the second floor. To get coffee or water, she would only fill up her cup half-way -- so she'd have to take twice as many trips to get the same amount.

Though it may be a universal human attribute, language is hardly simple. For decades, linguists' main task was to track and record languages. But, like so many areas of science, the field of linguistics has evolved dramatically over the past 50 years.

What he saw there must have seemed unreal: instead of dim rooms with tiny windows, typical of prevailing Romanesque styles, this space was ablaze with light from tall stained-glass windows. At the heart of this construction method was a profoundly simple engineering advantage: pointed rather than semi-circular arches in the walls and vaulted roof. Whereas semi-circular vaulting exerts sideways forces great enough to topple walls that aren't sufficiently thick, vaulting formed of pointed arches reduces lateral stress by as much as 50 percent, redirecting stress lines downward rather than outward, permitting thinner walls with large windows. For the next three centuries, this new ""French Style"" dominated the construction of castles, palaces, and cathedrals across Europe. By the 1450s, however, Renaissance architects called these structures Gothic, an expression of scorn. Today, without intending offence, we still refer to these masterpieces of medieval engineering as Gothic architecture.

Which of the following best restates the author's main point?

Little does the homeowner know, as it continues to rain, the fertilizer, dog waste, antifreeze and chemical-filled soap all wash into a nearby sewer and end up contaminating the local river.

It was easy for her to decide what to do: She wanted to get a glimpse of the city waking up and preparing for another typical weekday. Paloma's taxi dropped her off several blocks from the city center and she walked, inhaling the morning: empty streets being swept with large palm-tree leaves; closed store windows and dark chapels, asleep; people having breakfasts on their balconies and by open windows; and an army of motorbikes, still lined up from the evening before. She stopped by Sao Bento, an old Benedictine monastery near the city's financial district -- a local fixture. The doors flew open -- it was time for daybreak chants. As the monks' voices soared, Paloma stayed in the square, watching scraggly birds hunt for breakfast. The early-morning lull was already giving way to the busy rush hour.

In the passage, the author's purpose is most likely to

A.	describe Sao Bento.

Pele was born in the land of Hapakuela, a far-distant land at the edge of the sky, toward the southwest. There she lived with her parents until she was grown up, when she married Wahialoa; and to these were born a daughter named Laka, and a son named Menehune. But after a time Pele's husband, Wahialoa, was enticed away from her by Pele-kumulani. The deserted Pele, being much displeased and troubled in mind on account of her husband, started on her travels in search of him, and came in the direction of the Hawaiian Islands. Now, at that time these islands were a vast waste. There was no sea, nor was there any fresh water. When Pele set out on her journey, her parents gave her the sea to go with her and bear her canoes onward. So she sailed forward, flood-borne by the sea, until she reached the land of Pakuela, and thence onward to the land of Kanaloa. From her head she poured forth the sea.

According to the passage, Pele's feelings led her to

Parts of the Silk Road are still used today for transportation. The city of Samarkand is one of the oldest and most historically important cities along the Road, occupying a central position between China and Western Europe. It is thought to have been founded around 700 BC and has been the site of many notable events, including invasions by Alexander the Great, in 329 BC, and Genghis Khan, in 1220 AD. Following Genghis Khan, in 1370 Samarkand became the capital city of the empire of Tamerlane; later, it was the capital city of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (1925-1930), and in 2001 it was named a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today, Samarkand is the second largest city in the Republic of Uzbekistan, formed in 1991.

Born in 1879, Einstein lived and began his education in Germany. At the age of fifteen he withdrew from school and followed his family to Italy, where his father had relocated his electrical equipment manufacturing company. Einstein continued his education in Switzerland and trained to teach physics and mathematics. He earned both his diploma and Swiss citizenship in 1901, and in 1905, Einstein was awarded his doctoral degree. His academic career began in 1909 in Switzerland and continued in Germany after 1914 when he moved and became a German citizen. He remained there until 1933 when, for political reasons, he renounced his citizenship and emigrated to the United States. Einstein became a U.S. citizen in 1940, and continued his work in physics until his retirement in 1945. At the time of his death in 1955, he was considered the 20th century's most influential physicist.

The supposition of any real onward movement in society is as unwelcome and as untrue to these persons as was Galileo's theory concerning the revolution of the earth around the sun. They will assert, as indeed they may, that the same crimes are committed in all ages, with the same good deeds to counterbalance them and that the capital tendencies of human nature are always substantially the same. This also must be allowed. The error of these friends consists in overlooking the most characteristic and human of these tendencies, which is that of progressive desire. This trait, deeper and stronger than the mere love of change, pushes the whole heterogeneous mass of humanity onward in a way from which there is no return.

Along the eastern coast of the Adriatic, as far south as Montenegro, lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water. Where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away, the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock. … Great sinkholes, some of them six hundred feet deep and more, pockmark the surface of the land. The drainage is chiefly subterranean. Surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often underground. Fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away. Ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells, and the inhabitants depend on rain water.…

The purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867 marked the end of Russian efforts to expand trade and settlements to the Pacific coast of North America, and became an important step in the United States' rise as a great power in the Asia-Pacific region. Beginning in 1725, when Russian Czar Peter the Great dispatched Vitus Bering to explore the Alaskan coast, Russia had a keen interest in this region, which was rich in natural resources and lightly inhabited. As the United States expanded westward in the early 1800s, Americans soon found themselves in competition with Russian explorers and traders. The Russian Government, however, lacked the financial resources to support major settlements, or a military presence, along the Pacific coast of North America; permanent Russian settlers in Alaska never numbered more than four hundred. Defeat in the Crimean War further reduced Russian interest in this region.

Its diagonal route linked hundreds of predominantly rural communities in Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas to the city of Chicago, thus enabling farmers to transport grain and produce for redistribution. This diagonal configuration was particularly significant to the trucking industry, which by 1930 rivaled the railroad for preeminence in the American shipping industry. In addition to its abbreviated route between Chicago and the Pacific coast, Route 66 traversed essentially flat prairie lands and enjoyed a more temperate climate than that of northern highways, further enhancing its appeal to truckers. The Illinois Motor Vehicles Division reported that the number of trucks between Chicago and St. Louis increased from approximately 1,500 per day in 1931 to 7,500 a decade later. Twenty-five percent of these were large tractor-truck, semi-trailer outfits.

It is a curious fact that green coffee improves upon aging, whereas after roasting it deteriorates with time. Even when packed in the best containers, age shows to a disadvantage on the roasted bean. This is due to a number of causes, among which are oxidation, volatilization of the aroma, absorption of moisture and consequent hydrolysis, and alteration in the character of the aromatic principles. Doolittle and Wright in the course of some extensive experiments found that roasted coffee showed a continual gain in weight throughout 60 weeks, this gain being mostly due to moisture absorption. An investigation by Gould also demonstrated that roasted coffee gives off carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide upon standing.

According to the passage, which of the following is true of green coffee?

Not because he's shark-like in any way, but because when we were very young, he convinced our babysitter, against the expressed wish of our parents, to see a fictional movie about an unusually large, killer shark. I was too young to see such a scary movie and had nightmares about the shark for weeks. I'm an adult now, but still get sweaty palms and have trouble breathing -- physiological signs of a phobia, I'm told -- whenever I see even just an image of a shark. In other words, it doesn't have to be in the ocean swimming towards me for me to feel fear. It can be a live one in an aquarium behind inches of thick, unbreakable glass, a live one on television that I see before having time to cover my eyes, or even a still picture of one in a magazine that I can't help but to look at because I just turned the page.

Leaving a pet in your vehicle unattended while quickly running into the grocery store or grabbing a bite to eat at your favorite fast food joint may sound harmless, but the consequences can be devastating. Studies have shown that keeping a pet in a vehicle for as little as 15 minutes can be deadly. A comfortable 78 degree day may not appear dangerous, but in a car, temperatures can reach up to 90 degrees in just minutes and climb as high as 160 degrees if the vehicle is left sitting in direct sunlight. Rolling down the windows may seem like an easy solution to this problem, but does very little to lower the temperature inside a vehicle. Leaving the air conditioning on is also risky. There have been documented cases where vehicles have become overheated causing the cool air to cease, resulting in significant harm to pets left inside.

Routine vehicle maintenance can be tedious and time consuming, but the alternatives are fraught with downsides that will not only affect your wallet, but also the performance and longevity of your vehicle. By not having your car routinely inspected and maintained, small problems, often easily remedied by low-cost solutions, can quickly turn into big problems requiring immensely expensive solutions. For example, a year's worth of oil changes costs roughly $120 and minimizes the wear and tear on the engine. Skipping routine oil changes can cause serious and costly engine damage -- it costs nearly $4,000 to replace an engine. The same is true for brakes, plugs, filters, and even tires. All of these items are considered simple maintenance, but when left to deteriorate, can cause thousands of dollars in damage to other vehicle parts.

One of the earliest roller skates dates back to 1760, when Belgian inventor John Merlin designed, constructed, and then wore a pair of wheeled skates to a masquerade party and crashed into a large mirror, injuring himself. In the early 1800s, the Dutch took Merlin's idea further and put wheels on their ice skates so they could continue skating during the summer months. But it wasn't until 1819 that the first roller skate was patented. The patent was issued to inventor Monsieur Petitbled who created a skate with three inline wheels made of either wood, metal, or ivory. The skate also had a wood plate and a leather strap that would secure the skate to the foot. The problem with this design, however, was that it was difficult to turn. In 1823, Robert Tyers produced a skate that had five aligned wheels, but it could not follow a curved path. Then in 1863, James Plimpton invented a revolutionary four-wheel skate capable of turning. Over the ensuing decades, roller skating became a popular pastime.

However, the modern popularity of chewing gum might be traced to 1928 when Walter Diemer, a 23-year-old accountant for the Fleer Chewing Gum Company, created a new recipe that proved to be a huge boon for the gum business. Diemer's recipe produced less sticky and more flexible gum than the other gums sold at the time, and this consistency allowed chewers to blow bubbles. He used pink food coloring for his gum, since pink was the only available color at the factory. To test his product, Diemer brought five pounds of the gum to a grocery store.

Where was my uncle? I could easily imagine him tearing along some solitary road, gesticulating, talking to himself, cutting the air with his cane, and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics. Would he hit upon some clue? Would he come home in better humor? While these thoughts were passing through my brain, I mechanically took up the execrable puzzle and tried every imaginable way of grouping the letters. I put them together by twos, by threes, fours, and fives -- in vain. Nothing intelligible came out, except that the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth made ice in English; the eighty-fourth, eighty-fifth, and eighty-sixth, the word sir; then at last I seemed to find the Latin words rota, mutabile, ira, nec, atra.

According to the passage, which of the following activities does the narrator engage in?

A.	playing a game with his uncle
B.	writing a document using code
C.	deciphering a written document

For some time the little village of Meer slept quietly in the moonlight. There was not a sound to break the stillness, except once when Mother Van Hove's old rooster caught a glimpse of the waning moon through the window of the chicken-house, and crowed lustily, thinking it was the sun. The other roosters of the village, wiser than he, made no response to his call, and in a moment he, too, returned to his interrupted slumbers. But though there was as yet no sound to tell of their approach, the moon looked down upon three horsemen galloping over the yellow ribbon of road from Malines toward the little village. Soon the sound of the horses' hoofs beating upon the hardened earth throbbed through the village itself, and Fidel sat up on the kitchen doorstep, pricked up his ears, and listened. He heard the hoof-beats and awakened the echoes with a sharp bark.

Which of the author's phrases is an example of personification?

The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful color faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveler, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.

How does the author want you to feel about the voice?

If you think, from this prelude, that anything like a romance is preparing for you, reader, you never were more mistaken. Do you anticipate sentiment, and poetry, and reverie? Do you expect passion, and stimulus, and melodrama? Calm your expectations; reduce them to a lowly standard. Something real, cool, and solid lies before you; something unromantic as Monday morning, when all who have work wake with the consciousness that they must rise and betake themselves thereto. It is not positively affirmed that you shall not have a taste of the exciting, perhaps towards the middle and close of the meal….

As we were toiling up, I looked back again; there was the village spire, and the old grey parsonage beyond it, basking in a slanting beam of sunshine -- it was but a sickly ray, but the village and surrounding hills were all in somber shade, and I hailed the wandering beam as a propitious omen to my home. With clasped hands I fervently implored a blessing on its inhabitants, and hastily turned away; for I saw the sunshine was departing; and I carefully avoided another glance, lest I should see it in gloomy shadow, like the rest of the landscape.

H2LT uses hydrogen gas, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology, and energy efficient lamps to illuminate work areas. It may seem like a small thing, but there are about 100,000 diesel-powered mobile lighting towers in the United States that emit pollutants that are bad for the environment and unhealthy to breathe. Researchers conducted field tests of H2LT prototypes for four years to determine how well the technology performed. The system was used to provide lighting for many settings and weather conditions. Results indicated H2LT was durable and efficient despite exposure to extreme heat, humidity, and cold. Better yet, low noise levels and emissions were reported while using H2LT. The field tests are guiding efforts to improve the design of H2LT and ultimately bring it to the market, where it can serve as a sustainable source of lighting throughout the nation.

Based on the passage, H2LT lighting was field-tested

I had expected to see him in uniform, like the thousand and one pictures that purport to represent him, instead of which I found a very ordinary-looking, bearded man, with deep-set eyes, a wan countenance, and rather lank hair. He was square-built, a trifle below the medium height, and a man whom, had you passed him in the Nevski [a main avenue], you might have taken for a … small tradesman. But the room itself was a beautiful one, like all the apartments in Peterhof, semicircular in shape, with a great bay window looking out upon the wonderful fountains, all of which were throwing up their jets, with a great vista of greenery beyond.

Disillusioned after World War I, the United States struggled with the global commitments some felt could lead to more war and the national economic uncertainty that discouraged ambitious involvement of the country in world affairs. By the mid-1920s, isolationist tendencies encouraged new legislation that placed severe limits on immigration to the United States. America, however, did not retreat into complete isolation. The demands of commercial growth dictated ongoing government support for overseas private investment with Latin America and the rebuilding of Europe. Furthermore, the U.S. played a role in both international arms limitations talks and creating pacts aimed at securing a lasting peace. During the 1930s, the rise of fascism as a threat to international peace sparked concern, but severe economic depression curtailed American willingness to act. It was in this environment that the desire to keep the nation out of the brewing tensions in Europe and Asia influenced the nation's foreign policy goals during the interwar years.

For almost the first time since their departure from Boston Priscilla was now in good spirits; she had overcome her original homesickness, and her letters from Plymouth had been so cheerful that she was almost ready to find enjoyment in the new scenes and faces. Between her and Martine there was less intimacy than between her and Amy. Mrs. Redmond was sorry to see that, for some reason, Priscilla lacked confidence in Martine. This was to be accounted for, perhaps, by the fact that the two girls were so unlike in temperament and education. Though reserved in speech, Priscilla was uncompromisingly accurate in statement; Martine, on the other hand, while apparently unreserved, occasionally lacked frankness. No one could accuse her of being untruthful, and yet her exaggerations and her occasional concealments were a constant annoyance to the literal Priscilla.

The use of the wand is regarded by the uninitiated as a mere affectation on the part of the performer, but such is far from being the case. Its uses are legion. In addition to the prestige derived from the traditional properties of the wand, which has been the mystic emblem of the magician's power from time immemorial, it is absolutely necessary for the successful carrying-out of many experiments, as will be seen in the course of the present work. For instance, having palmed a coin, say in the right hand, you lower that hand and take up the wand, which effectually conceals, in a perfectly natural manner, the presence of the coin. The wand is now passed once or twice over the left hand, which is supposed to contain the coin, and on opening the hand the coin will be found to have vanished. It will thus be seen that the wand is of the utmost importance.

On the 30th of July, 1914, motoring north from Poitiers, we had lunched somewhere by the roadside under apple trees on the edge of a field. Other fields stretched away on our right and left to a border of woodland and a village steeple. All around was noonday quiet, and the sober disciplined landscape which the traveler's memory is apt to evoke as distinctively French. Sometimes, even to accustomed eyes, these ruled-off fields and compact grey villages seem merely flat and tame; at other moments the sensitive imagination sees in every thrifty sod and even furrow the ceaseless vigilant attachment of generations faithful to the soil. The particular bit of landscape before us spoke in all its lines of that attachment. The air seemed full of the long murmur of human effort, the rhythm of oft-repeated tasks, the serenity of the scene smiled away the war rumors which had hung on us since morning.

Ten years after the launch of his career, Pollock’s work started to gain appreciation from others in the art world. He is known for introducing the “drip and splash” technique in the late 1940s, which involved laying the canvas on the floor and dripping paint on it directly from the can. Pollock didn’t use the traditional artist’s paintbrush, but instead opted for knives, trowels, or sticks. Many modern-day critics believe that this technique allowed the artist to express stronger emotion and mood on the canvas. Pollock’s art was also unique in that his work was devoid of any focal point; the whole canvas was deemed equally important.

Though pottery was used to a small degree by tribes that relied mostly on hunting, the craft of handmade pottery flourished amongst the farming tribes. Over time, Native American pottery began to take assorted shapes depending on its purpose, which might involve storing grain, preserving seeds, or holding water. Ultimately, the creation of cooking pots able to sustain exposure to open flames represented the technical peak of this practical art form. As beautiful as Native American pottery is, its roots can be traced back to the need to store large quantities of food during the harvest season.

But heirloom tomato plants are less productive and may not be as resistant to diseases that come from the soil as are other more common varieties of tomatoes. So I recently ordered a special product from my gardening catalog: plants that have the tops, or scions, of heirloom tomatoes grafted onto the rootstock of very hardy tomato varieties. As a novice gardener, I found the plants ready to place in the ground, which did not require any grafting expertise. The instructions warned that I might lose about a third of the rather fragile young plants, but that the ones that survived would produce more tomatoes than regular heirloom tomato plants. I was thrilled with these grafted plants, because they needed less irrigation and fertilizing than regular heirloom tomato plants. If you love growing heirloom tomatoes, this approach will be the solution to your gardening woes.

Artificial plants will remain as lush and vigorous looking as when first bought, will not shed leaves or petals, and will not attract insects. Furthermore, they do not require any special care and do not have finite lifespans. Alternatively, live plants are fragrant, provide air purification by removing harmful chemicals such as benzene and formaldehyde, release oxygen, and add moisture to dry spaces. Additionally, live plants, such as aloe, can be used for medicinal purposes and some, such as herbs or microgreens, can be grown to eat. The main differences between the two are the ease of care and possible health benefits. However, one benefit that both have in common is that any type of greenery, whether natural or faux, will beautifully enhance all types of settings.

Showy, fragrant flowers with large pollen grains may seem like the cause of people’s allergies, but the truth is that most pollen that causes allergies does not come from flowers at all. Flowering plants produce heavy, waxy pollen grains that are usually moved around by insects. In contrast, plants such as trees, weeds, and grasses have tiny, light pollen grains that are easily picked up by the wind, carried for miles, and responsible for triggering allergic reactions. Because some of these plants can produce up to a million grains of pollen a day, it is close to impossible to avoid breathing them in during certain seasons. The best method to prevent or at least reduce allergic reactions to pollen would be to stay indoors, especially on windy days.

Color is therefore more than just what our senses perceive; it is a blend of sensory input and cognitive mental processes that define, express, and embody experiences and understandings of the world. Human brains can turn reflected light into learned symbols of actions, emotions, and abstract ideas. For example, the particular wavelength perceived by the human eye as the color red becomes associated with various ideas including “stop,” “anger,” or “fortune.” The biological process in which our eyes see reflected light then joins with a social and psychological process that ties colors to culturally or universally significant meanings and emotions.

In discussing color, the author’s primary focus is on the

We may conceive a case in which unlimited abundance would destroy not only the value, but the utility of a whole class of commodities; would prevent them not merely from being objects of exchange, but even from being objects of desire. This would be the case as to all the commodities whose only utility is to be a means of displaying wealth. If emeralds were suddenly to become as abundant as pebbles, they could be no longer used as ornaments; and if no other use could be made of them, and I am not aware of any, they would be valueless. All their possessors, at the time of the change, would find themselves poorer, and neither they nor anyone else would be compensated by any increased means of enjoyment.

When exposed to light through a camera lens, this mixture forms clusters of silver. The more light there is, the higher the density of the silver clusters. After light exposure, the film is removed from the camera, chemically treated in complete darkness, and then washed with water. Thus a negative is created, with dark areas containing a higher concentration of silver. To make a print, a similar but reverse process is carried out. The negative is placed in a machine that resembles a slide projector, called an enlarger. Light is projected through the negative and focused through a lens onto a piece of light sensitive paper coated with another type of silver mixture. Dark areas of the negative will appear light in the print, and the light areas of the negative will appear dark. Further chemical processing of the exposed paper creates a final print.

Based on the passage, a negative can form a print when the negative is

they escape predators or find one another to mate? Well, it turns out that perhaps 80% of multicellular sea life living at depths greater than 600 feet have special organs that produce chemical light, like fireflies do. This light is commonly used in defense, and to find or attract prey. For example, bristlemouths use their light organs for camouflage. Lanternfish, a similar group of fish living in the same part of the ocean as bristlemouths, have light organs that they use for communication in addition to ones for camouflage. Other sea creatures, called dragonfish, have light structures that emit red light and help them spot their prey. Because most fish can detect only blue light, potential prey are not alerted to the predatory dragonfish looming nearby. 

Based on the passage, both lanternfish and bristlemouths have special light structures that

An earthquake is the vibration, sometimes violent, of the Earth’s surface that follows a release of energy in the Earth’s crust. This energy can be generated by a sudden dislocation of segments of the crust, by a volcanic eruption, or even by manmade explosions. Most destructive quakes, however, are caused by dislocations of the crust. The crust may first bend and then, when the stress exceeds the strength of the rocks, break and “snap” to a new position. In the process of breaking, vibrations called “seismic waves” are generated. These waves travel outward from the source of the earthquake along the surface and through the Earth at varying speeds depending on the material through which they move. Some of the vibrations are of high enough frequency to be audible, while others are of very low frequency. 

According to the passage, what happens just as Earth’s crust breaks?

Although they share some features and many people refer to them interchangeably, they are in fact two very different species of trees. Giant redwoods thrive in the coastal region of the state amid the marine fog, which provides moisture to the soil and ideal conditions for growth. Giant sequoias flourish on the slopes of an inland mountain range, where regular intervals of dry heat are needed for their cones to release seeds. Giant redwoods are typically taller than giant sequoias, but giant sequoias have much thicker branches and tend to outweigh giant redwoods substantially. The bark of giant sequoias is also thicker, 3 feet compared to 12 inches for giant redwoods. One common feature of both types of trees is that they live a very long time, up to 2,000 years for the giant redwoods and 3,000 years for giant sequoias.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Giant redwoods and giant sequoias grow at high elevations.
B.	Giant redwoods and giant sequoias require the same climate.
C.	Giant redwoods are usually taller and heavier than giant sequoias.
D.	Giant redwoods have thinner branches and bark than giant sequoias.

Peonies usually bloom around the world in the late spring to early summer, and growers compete for customers of these prized cut flowers. But in Alaska peonies don’t begin to bloom until July and continue blooming through late August. Alaska’s commercially grown peonies are unusually large, due in part to the many hours of sunlight they receive in the summertime. The harsh climate of Alaska also fends off many diseases and insects, and the biggest garden pest in Alaska, the moose, hates the taste of the flower. Increased interest in cultivating peonies for profit in Alaska means that the peony season now extends through summer’s end, giving peonies a chance to become as popular as another flower, available year-round, the rose.

The passage suggests that peonies grown commercially in Alaska

A.	have a special aroma.
B.	need minimal tending.

Parrots make great pets, and their ability to mimic sounds makes them endlessly entertaining and truly unique. African grey parrots are prime examples of this. One 17-year-old African grey parrot named Einstein was said to have learned over 100 phrases, such as “be quiet” and “eat your broccoli,” as well as over 20 distinct sounds, like a train whistle and the beep of a microwave. African grey parrots can have the intelligence of a five-year-old child, and caring for one can be just as time consuming. With a life span of up to 50 years in captivity, an African grey parrot is only recommended for those willing to make a lifelong commitment; however, with every additional year of pet ownership comes additional opportunities for the parrot to expand its vocabulary.

But beyond appreciating the superficial appeal of seashells, few people stop to consider what interesting objects they really are. Seashells are the external skeletons of marine animals such as snails, clams, and oysters, and they serve as a protective layer to shield the animals from predators or strong currents. Shells develop on these marine animals as their bodies release calcium carbonate, the mineral that comprises the shell. As the animal grows, the shell grows along with it. The calcium carbonate that is released builds up over time and results in the variety of patterns that make each species relatively easy to identify. Once the animals die, some seashells wash up on beaches, where they are found by happy beachcombers.

It is therefore more accurate to describe Ford not as an inventor, but as an innovator. Henry Ford is a shining example of the merits of ingenuity, perseverance, and dedication. Breaking new ground is risky and takes confidence, a quality Ford had in abundance. This characteristic led him to take the latest technology available and tweak it to make it marketable, useful, and applicable for the masses. We know Ford is an example of a successful businessman, but he was also well acquainted with, but not deterred by, failure. Despite the fact that the first two businesses he designed to sell “horseless carriages” to the public failed, Ford finally reached success in founding his third automotive company.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

Localization is what companies do to tailor their products or services to fit a certain market in another country. For example, a food service company might change the ingredients in its products to adapt to local tastes in the target location. To successfully localize products, companies must also be thoughtful of local sensitivities by avoiding culturally inappropriate content. In some cases, movies or books must be adapted to adhere to local customs and laws. To increase the possibility of using material globally, simplifying messages and designs during the localization process is important. Local formats must also be implemented, such as changing the units of measuring speed on a car from kilometers to miles per hour for the United States. There is so much more to localization than just translation!

According to the passage, what should companies do to achieve localization?

A.	use consistent units of measure

This technique produces results that are very difficult to achieve using traditional cooking methods. Sous vide accomplishes nearly perfect juicy, tender cuts of meat and delicate poached eggs, whereas pan-fried meats and eggs poached in saucepans can easily be over- or under-cooked. The primary reason to cook sous vide is the enhancement of flavor and texture that comes from controlling the temperature and sealing the food. Other advantages of sous vide are that it produces consistent results and reduces the loss of natural fats and juices. Additionally, this method spares a few minutes of time needed to cook a dish, allowing the chef to use that time to focus on other preparation.

According to the passage, the primary reason to cook sous vide is the

A.	reduced loss of fats and juices.

Then ingredients such as rennet and a starter culture are added to coagulate or curdle the milk. The curds are next drained from the liquid called whey and put into a shaped container, where they are pressed together to form a single mass. The final stage, which can take as little as two weeks to more than two years, is maturation or ripening. During this time, biochemical changes related to the growth of mold and additional bacteria create the cheese’s flavor, aroma, and texture.

The value of an old book is influenced by a multitude of factors: eminence of the author, scarcity of production, physical condition, and even who previously owned it. When determining value, first consider the author. Did the author write a pioneering piece in a specific field? Was the author famous? An obscure name in conjunction with ordinary subject matter unfortunately leads to a book having little financial value. Next, the degree of damage to the book is critical. A work that is worth thousands of dollars in excellent shape could easily be worth a mere pittance if it is visibly worn or missing pages. For this reason, books from libraries that have due date stamps or other markings often have little value. Lastly, is the book a first edition or a later printing? How many copies are in circulation? If only a small number of copies were printed, the value of each can reach thousands of dollars.

Based on the passage, which of the following characteristics of an old book will most likely enhance its monetary value?

What the sincere novelist does is practically to say to his reader: “Here is a portion of life as it seems to me it is or might be. I tell you the whole of its reality or its possibility as far as I can perceive it. What it means, what is the lesson to be drawn from it, you must discover for yourself. In the first place the emotions which I have felt in writing the tale cannot be directly expressed. I have endeavored to suggest them, and that is all that can be done by means of language. In the second place, the moral of life will be vital only to him who draws it for himself.” Of course it is impossible to determine how far one novelist or another would definitely say to himself anything of this sort; but I believe that this is the position consciously or unconsciously taken by every serious writer of fiction.

Which of the following best restates the author’s main point about serious writers of fiction?

Dogs play such a big part in the lives of many families that few people ever stop to wonder how they came to be “man’s best friend.” Research teams have studied this issue and come up with several theories. First, they agree that at some point in history, humans discovered how to tame wolves, which caused them eventually to evolve into the dogs we are familiar with today. However, no one is exactly sure when and where this process began. Some studies compared genetic material of ancient and modern dogs and proposed that the first dogs were domesticated in the Middle East or Asia about 15,000 years ago, when wolves started feasting on garbage generated by farmers. Another study analyzed genetic material from wolves, ancient dogs, and modern dogs and concluded that all domestic dogs originated in Europe 19,000 to 32,000 years ago, when nomadic humans and wolves engaged in mutually beneficial efforts to track and kill food. Neither theory is conclusive, so researchers continue to look into where and how this friendship began.

This morning, May 5, as I walked through the fields the west wind brought to me a sweet, fresh odor, like that of fragrant violets, precisely like that of our little white sweet violet (Viola blanda). I do not know what it came from, -- probably from sugar maples, just shaking out their fringe-like blossoms, -- but it was the first breath of May, and very welcome. April has her odors, too, very delicate and suggestive, but seldom is the wind perfumed with the breath of actual bloom before May. I said it is Warbler time; the first arrivals of the pretty little migrants should be noted now. Hardly had my thought defined itself when before me, in a little hemlock, I caught the flash of a blue, white-barred wing; then glimpses of a yellow breast and a yellow crown. I approached cautiously, and in a moment more had a full view of one of our rarer Warblers, the Blue-winged Yellow Warbler.

Hand tools are often neglected in the search for the pleasing objects of the past. Considered too utilitarian, their decorative appeal -- the mellow patina of the wood plane or the delicately tapered legs of a pair of dividers -- often goes unnoticed. Surprisingly modern in design, the ancient carpenter's or cabinetmaker's tool has a vitality of line that can, without reference to technical significance, make it an object of considerable grace and beauty. The hand tool is frequently a lively and decorative symbol of a society at a given time -- a symbol, which, according to the judges at London's Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851, gives “indications of the peculiar condition and habits of the people whence they come, of their social and industrial wants and aims, as well as their natural or acquired advantages.” The hand tool, therefore, should be considered both as an object of appealing shape and a document illustrative of society and its progress.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

The ancient form of the Olympic Games, believed to have begun in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, started out with only one event, a foot race, but over the years grew to include events such as wrestling and chariot racing. Only young men from Greece were allowed to participate in the ancient games, and the winner received an olive branch. The first modern incarnation of the Olympic Games began in 1896 in Athens, Greece. An American named James Connolly won the triple jump on the opening day of the games and became the first modern Olympic champion. Connolly’s athletic skill extended beyond the triple jump, as he also placed second in the high jump and third in the long jump. Though third place came without decoration, Connolly was awarded a silver medal and an olive branch for his first place win and a copper medal and laurel branch for his second place win.

Through the 1870s, there were thousands of time zones in the U.S., with many towns and cities basing their local time on when the sun was at its highest point in the sky. The expansion of the railroads across the country brought the shortening of travel times, and some trips that used to take days or weeks could be completed in a matter of hours. This made it incredibly difficult for railroad companies to schedule arrival and departure times, as the diversity of time zones resulted in dozens of different listings for the same train. On November 18, 1883, the railroad companies banded together to establish four time zones in North America in order to run their businesses more efficiently. Canada and the U.S. quickly took to this new system, and the dividing lines between the continental time zones are still very close to the ones we are familiar with today.

With the onslaught of World War II, however, the U.S. was faced with a potentially devastating shortage of natural rubber. The countries of Southeast Asia had been supplying the U.S. with most of its rubber, but as Japan moved to conquer these countries, the critical resource became unavailable. The U.S. government believed that the war would be lost if a suitable alternative was not produced quickly, so it began working with scientists and technologists to develop a synthetic rubber replacement. Rubber companies, university laboratories, and government researchers all joined forces and successfully created a substitute that could be produced efficiently and satisfied criteria for quality.

A plan by James Hoban, a young Irish American, was among the many reviewed by a committee and chosen the winner. The plan included a ground floor designated for official business, an upper floor designated as living space for the president’s family, and a partially above-ground basement. Some thought the design of the house was too large, and others worried about having adequate stone to construct it, so George Washington agreed that the basement would not be built.

It is famous for being the biggest fish in the ocean, a graceful swimmer that can reach a length of 40 feet or more. While such a large fish may seem intimidating to any divers who encounter them in the wild, whale sharks are usually found alone and are actually very safe to swim near. When their food is abundant, as it can be in warm waters off the shores of Mexico and the Philippines, they will congregate. That makes these special sharks a tourist attraction for those who seek the chance to commune and photograph the calm, massive fish in their natural habitat. Whale sharks can live for over 70 years, but they produce few offspring, so it’s important that humans treat these special fish with care. We are, in fact, their only known predator.

For about 400 years, many brave explorers perished in a vain attempt to find a Northwest Passage, a passable water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific along the northern coast of North America. It was an epic hunt, but was it worth it? A navigable route would have proved very lucrative, as it would significantly reduce the time and cost of transporting goods between Europe and Asia. John Cabot, one of the earliest explorers to attempt the search, was soon followed by equally unsuccessful expeditions led by Sir Francis Drake, Captain James Cook, and many others. However, it was the voyage of Sir John Franklin in 1845 that was perhaps the most ill-fated, as he and all 128 of his men vanished and were never heard from again. Finally, in 1905, after centuries of sunken ships and drowned sailors, Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen, found a route. The actual Northwest Passage turned out to be a dangerous channel through the frigid and deadly northern region of Canada. This brought to a close one of the most perilous eras in exploration, all for a route that is treacherous to navigate even today.

One type, an apparent bloom, is caused by strong currents or winds pushing the jellyfish more closely together, making it appear that their numbers have increased. The other type is called a true bloom, because the jellyfish population actually increases. The cause of true blooms is not known by scientists, but they do have a few hypotheses. Possible reasons might be a change in water temperature, the overfishing of natural predators of jellyfish, or an increase in their food source due to nutrients in the water from contaminants such as agricultural runoff. Either type of bloom can pose a danger to humans, who may be stung by jellyfish tentacles. Additionally, jellyfish from blooms can disrupt the fishing industry by ripping nets and hurting fish, or by entering coastal fish farms and suffocating fish. Scientists are studying blooms to learn more about them, hoping to reduce the possible harm they pose.

For apartment dwellers, an indoor garden is the most feasible. Any window that gets a minimum of about six hours of sunlight each day can support plants such as lettuce, peppers, or tomatoes. For gardening outside the home, container gardening -- which involves growing plants in any kind of vessel instead of planting them in the ground -- is another option, as it requires just a small, sunny space like a patio or balcony. Another option for urban residents without any balcony or patio area is to seek out a community garden program, which rents or gives free access to land. Any of these approaches to raising vegetables is well worth the time and effort for the rewards they bring.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	identify complications of gardening in the city.
B.	advocate renting land from farms in rural areas.
C.	recommend growing lettuce, peppers, or tomatoes.
D.	persuade city residents to grow their own vegetables.

In contrast to quantitative research, which involves collecting objective data such as numbers and statistics, qualitative research is a method of study that involves subjective data, such as observations about what people do and say. Qualitative research is widely used by social scientists to learn about human behavior, emotion, and personality traits. While quantitative research often utilizes structured experiments and constructs statistical models to explain findings, qualitative research is usually collected from direct observations of people in their environment. Qualitative data can be analyzed to understand the patterns or anomalies regarding human interactions in social settings. An example of this would be a researcher silently observing and recording parent-teacher interactions to understand how behaviors relate to the power dynamic between the two parties.

According to the passage, quantitative researchers analyze observations by

A.	classifying the personality traits of individuals.
B.	creating statistical models from numerical data.
C.	gathering information about groups in social settings.

After a writer has finished the manuscript of a book and decided on the genre that best describes it, the writer should search for a literary agent. Agents are experts in the publishing industry and can help authors find good publishers and negotiate the best deals. Next, the writer should submit the manuscript to an editor at the agent’s recommended publisher. The editor reads the manuscript and determines whether to reject or publish the book. If it is accepted, the publisher buys the rights to the book from the author and usually pays some amount of money in advance in anticipation of future royalties. The publisher then designs marketing materials, such as the cover, before printing and distributing the book.

Based on the passage, what happens just before the rights to a book are purchased?

A.	An editor reads the author’s manuscript.
B.	An agent helps the author find a publisher.
C.	The publisher designs the cover for the book.

The last week of March had seen rain, snow and hail; had felt the wind shift from brisk North to snarling Southeast, and from warm, rain-weighted South to an Easterly gale such as nipped the veins in a man's body and daunted the over-hasty green of elderberry and lifted the wet from ploughed fields as speedily as if a July sun had scorched them. From day to day -- nay from hour to hour -- the farm men had not known whether they would shiver at the hardest work or sweat with the easiest; the moist, untimely heat of one day would plant rheumatism snugly in their joints, and the bitter coldness of the next would weld it in. Nature was dead at heart, it seemed, and whether she showed a dry eye or a tearful, her face wore the dull greyness of despair, as if her thews [muscles] were too stiffened and too lean with age to rouse themselves for the old labor of bringing buds to leaf, and kine [cows] to calving.

His face was a strong -- a very strong -- aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.

The trees in a forest are all helped by mutually protecting each other against high winds, and by producing a richer and moister soil than would be possible if the trees stood singly and apart. They compete among themselves by their roots for moisture in the soil, and for light and space by the growth of their crowns in height and breadth. Perhaps the strongest weapon which trees have against each other is growth in height. In certain species intolerant of shade, the tree which is overtopped has lost the race for good. The number of young trees which destroy each other in this fierce struggle for existence is prodigious, so that often a few score per acre are all that survive to middle or old age out of many tens of thousands of seedlings which entered the race of life on approximately even terms.

In discussing trees in a forest, the author’s primary focus is on their

After a time these newly-met forces will adjust themselves to the altered condition, and a larger, finer stream be the result. Something analogous to this would seem to be happening in art at the present time, when all nations and all schools are acting and reacting upon each other, and art is losing its national characteristics. The hope of the future is that a larger and deeper art, answering to the altered conditions of humanity, will result.

Just as biology seeks to answer the question “What is life?”; zoology, “What is an animal?”; botany, “What is a plant?”; so sociology seeks to answer the question “What is society?” or perhaps better, “What is association?” Just as biology, zoology, and botany cannot answer their questions until those sciences have reached their full and complete development, so also sociology cannot answer the question “What is society?” until it reaches its final development. Nevertheless, some conception or definition of society is necessary for the beginner, for in the scientific discussion of social problems we must know first of all what we are talking about. We must understand in a general way what society is, what sociology is, what the relations are between sociology and other sciences, before we can study the social problems of today from a sociological point of view.

I dislike the phrase. We do not go to the green woods and crystal waters to rough it, we go to smooth it. We get it rough enough at home; in towns and cities; in shops, offices, stores, banks, anywhere that we may be placed -- with the necessity always present of being on time and up to our work; of providing for the dependent ones; of keeping up, catching up, or getting left.

They were long thought to be a type of fungus. Though a true mold is indeed a fungus, a slime mold is not actually a mold at all, but a protist. Protists are one-celled organisms that are not classified as plants, animals, or fungi, but have characteristics of all three and are now considered their own group. Protists have long fascinated and perplexed scientists. For example, protists can move and can react to their environment in intelligent ways. Their behavior suggests they have memory, can anticipate, and make decisions. Because protists are unlike most life forms, including microscopic forms like bacteria, and have existed much longer than most organisms, scientists believe they may have led the way for the evolution of the earliest plants and animals.

To achieve this, a group of humpbacks dive below their prey. One whale swims in a spiral pattern while using its blowhole to release a ring of bubbles. At the same time, another whale produces sounds that further scare the fish, causing them to group together in a tight ball within the center of the bubble ring. All of the remaining whales then position themselves below the ball of fish and lunge to the surface with their mouths wide open to catch the fish. At the surface, the whales clamp their jaws shut and force water through their sieve-like baleen plates, trapping the fish inside their mouths. With one giant gulp, each whale swallows thousands of fish -- an efficient way to maximize the amount of fish a whale eats. This display is considered to be a highly organized and complex cooperative activity -- no less so than some observed activities of primates.

According to the passage, the bubble net technique is an effective way for humpbacks to

They also use color to convey certain moods, attitudes, or meanings based on how humans associate colors with nature or with abstract concepts. For example, people traditionally relate blue with the sky and green with vegetation. Red is another color connected to nature; it is associated with blood and fire, which can be used by artists to communicate energy or strong feelings. Yellows and oranges are typically associated with the heat of the sun and thus can express the idea of warmth. Because of these associations, certain colors can stimulate the viewer in ways that help achieve the artist’s goals. Clearly, artists choose their color pallet carefully to create images that will have memorable, lasting effects.

These paints are generally a mixture of pigments, resins, solvents, and additives. Pigments provide color and can be categorized in two groups: prime and extender. Resins, the binders that keep the pigment particles together and give paint the ability to stick to the object being painted, come in a variety of types depending on what the paint is used for. Alkyd resins, for example, are used in enamel paints that coat outdoor objects such as cars and houses. Less expensive paints for other purposes use polyvinyl acetate resins. The third part of the paint mixture is solvents, which act as carriers; that is, they keep the pigment and resin evenly distributed in the paint. Finally, additives are used to enhance the paint in some way, such as to make it mold resistant. Knowing what goes into a can of paint may help you decide what to use for your next painting project.

The national observatory of England -- the noblest institution in the world for the extent and exactitude of its astronomical tables, and their practical value in the art of navigation -- was originated by the spread of foreign commerce. The growth of colonies across the Atlantic, together with the establishment of relations with India, rendered it of the first importance to have an easy and accurate method of finding the longitude at sea. A plan was proposed, founded upon the principle now in use, of observing the lunar motions and distances during a voyage, and comparing them with a previous home calculation, thus ascertaining the difference between home time and time at sea, from whence the difference of longitude is readily deduced.

Swift as is the steamer, the rail-car is doubly and trebly swift. Some trains in England run at the rate of seventy miles an hour. This is as fast as a balloon moves through the air, or a storm wind. It is the most rapid means of travel ever known among men, and it is only within the past thirty or forty years that the railroad has reached this rapid rate of speed. The engine used on the rail-car is smaller and more compact than the machinery of the steamer. Its piston, crank, and boiler must all be confined within a very limited space. It is the most wonderful and elegant of all the labors of the mechanic.

These had to be within easy sailing distance of one or more regular trade routes, and at the same time had to be in some quiet spot unlikely to be visited by strange craft, and, besides being sheltered from storms, must have a suitable beach on which their vessels could be careened and the hulls scraped of barnacles and weeds. The greatest stronghold of the buccaneers was at Tortuga, or Turtle Island, a small island lying off the west coast of Hispaniola. Here in their most piping days flourished a buccaneer republic, where the seamen made their own laws and cultivated the land for sugar-cane and yams.

Upon closer inspection, doors and windows become visible, revealing that many of the rock formations actually contain homes. The people of Kandovan inhabit these formations, some of which have been in use for at least 700 years. Natural or human-carved cavities form the rooms within these multistory dwellings, which comfortably house entire families. As an added bonus, the thermal mass of the rock ceilings, floors, and walls make these homes energy efficient, keeping them relatively cool during summer and warm during winter. Although many of these homes have been modernized with the addition of electricity, running water, and appliances, few need supplemental heating or cooling systems. When possible, exterior additions are made of natural materials or are painted in earth tones, to help ensure that the homes continue to blend with their natural surroundings for centuries to come.

These massive creatures, which stand over six feet tall and literally weigh a ton, used to number in the tens of millions and, in the Great Plains region, played an important role in the ecological system. The many grazing bison helped prairie dogs survive by keeping grass short, giving them an unobstructed view of predators, and bison were a major food source for wolves. During the 1800s, however, unregulated shooting decimated the population, leaving merely a thousand of them by the turn of the next century. Since that time, the bison population has rebounded and approximately half a million live in North America. Most are not wild, but have been crossbred with cattle and are semi-domesticated. A significant danger to wild bison still exists in the form of disease transmitted by elk and cattle, and efforts are underway to introduce disease-free bison into new conservation herds to help boost the numbers of this natural treasure.

Producing so many coins a day is a complex process that requires machines and their operators to work together quickly and efficiently. First, blanks of the coins are punched from strips of metal. These blanks are heated in a furnace, then washed and dried. After this, the blanks go through a machine called an upsetting mill, which forms a rim around their edges. Next, blanks are stamped with their designs, such as graphics, monetary values, and mottos, by a coining press. The resulting coins are inspected by operators using magnifying glasses. Finally, the coins are run through an automatic counting machine and packaged for shipment to Federal Reserve Banks, which distribute the coins to local banks across the country.

The common glowworm found in Europe, classified in the Lamphyridae family, is one of several types of bioluminescent insects that create a chemical reaction in their bodies that causes them to glow. These organisms are not actually worms, but rather elongated beetles, and only the adult females of this species emit a truly bright glow. The flightless females produce their green-yellow light to attract the winged males. The males also glow, as do the larvae, but their lights are fainter and more difficult to see. In contrast, the glow of the adult female’s body is easily visible, even to humans, particularly during the dark of night when they display their light for several hours. Of course, they are much more difficult to see in the presence of artificial light such as streetlights and flashlights. Another bioluminescent insect, not in the Lamphyridae family, is found only in New Zealand. Though it is commonly called a glowworm, it is a type of fly, not a beetle. The worm-like larvae of this fly often inhabit caves and produce glowing blue chains to attract and ensnare their prey.

There, in the 1600s, it was woven from sheep’s wool and became fundamental to clothing as well as bed covers in this land of harsh winters. The fabric was quickly picked up in England and France, where it was produced extensively throughout the Industrial Revolution thanks to new capabilities in manufacturing. In the United States, durable flannel became the perfect fabric for Civil War soldiers’ coats and undershirts, and it was later used in World War I to line soldiers’ jackets. A turning point came in the late 1950s, when flannel transitioned to become a fashionable fabric for business suits. Changing fashions saw plaid-patterned flannel shirts in the 1990s associated with the messy, casual attire of some rock and roll band members.

For this program, the Army Air Corps selected a small group of African-Americans with college degrees who would receive basic flight training, and then, if successful, advanced training. In this way, all-black fighter squadrons were created. History would come to remember these trailblazers as the Tuskegee Airmen. The tenacious pilots overcame discrimination, such as being issued substandard equipment, to become highly respected for their actions in World War II. Over a thousand courageous Tuskegee Airmen are credited with over 1,500 missions and a perfect success rate escorting bombers past enemy fighters. The Tuskegee Airmen, triumphant in military service, were at the forefront of history, and their bravery and fortitude in battle led the way to official desegregation of the U.S. Armed Forces in 1948.

The main point of the passage is that the Tuskegee Airmen

A.	were heroic pilots.
B.	were patriotic soldiers.
C.	broke racial boundaries.
D.	helped win World War II.

This attribute makes it possible for dogs to become invaluable assistants, performing activities rivaling those of a human aide. Take the case of a trained Labrador retriever who routinely assisted his wheelchair-bound owner by taking items from out-of-reach store shelves to help him grocery shop, handing payment to bus drivers to help him get around town, and operating a machine with a bank card to get access to cash in an account. When the owner had an accident and fell out of his wheelchair, the dog propped him into a safe position, placed a blanket over him, and sought help, as trained, saving the owner from further injury. This dog received recognition as a heroic dog, but it is far from the only dog capable of performing such services. In addition to being loyal companions, trained service dogs can be of great help, notably to physically challenged owners or to owners with specific needs.

The author of the passage is most likely trying to

A.	entertain the reader with the story of a heroic dog.
B.	refute the claim that dogs are only suitable for use as pets.
C.	convince the reader that trained dogs can provide critical services.
D.	illustrate the reasons that dogs are superior to humans as assistants.

There are four common styles of lapidary, and they vary in difficulty as well as in the cost of the tools required. The least expensive method is called tumbling and requires a revolving barrel containing abrasives to turn rough rocks into smooth, rounded stones. Cabbing, used to create a polished rock or gem with a flat bottom and domed top, demands more expensive equipment but can be easily learned. Faceting is a complex and expensive technique, and usually entails cutting and polishing an entire gemstone in a symmetrical pattern. The method requiring the most artistic sense and knowledge of gemstone cutting principles is carving, for which tools may need to be custom made. Using these methods, working with stones can be a satisfying hobby or a profitable endeavor.

According to the passage, what method of lapidary produces a rounded gem with a flat bottom?

A.	carving
B.	cabbing

The largest species is aptly named the giant hummingbird and lives in many countries, including Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Chile. One species from Cuba called the bee hummingbird holds the record for being the smallest of all the bird species. About five to six centimeters in size, it weighs about as much as a U.S. penny. Another hummingbird, the horned sungem, is a year-round resident of Brazil and has one of the fastest average wing beat rates. Interestingly, all hummingbird species can fly backwards, a capability very few other birds have. Thanks to their particular wing structure and musculature, hummingbirds are able to fly in almost any direction without the assistance of wind.

We will first stop at the nearby salt factory, which produces over 25,000 tons of table salt from the salt flats per year. At the salt flats, you will encounter several spectacular sights, like a hotel that is actually constructed of salt and furnished with sculptures made of salt. If it is the rainy season and the salt flats are coated with a little water, you may witness a fascinating optical illusion. Have your camera ready to photograph people who look like they are walking or driving among clouds, thanks to the thin layer of water acting like a mirror. You will also want to capture images of the gigantic pyramids of salt formed by the miners of the salt flats. Daily departures are at 10:30 a.m. from our tour office.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about Salar de Uyuni is correct?

A.	It reflects the sky after it rains.

The random sampling method is well known, where statistics are used to identify participants from a defined population in such a way that each person has an equal chance of being selected. This method is used to produce results that can be considered generally representative of a target population. Another approach, non-probability sampling, can be used when a population is not known or well defined, and therefore participants cannot be randomly selected from it. To study such populations, such as homeless individuals in a community, researchers may use availability or snowball sampling methods. In availability sampling, the easiest method, researchers choose the most conveniently reachable participants. Snowball sampling encourages selected participants to recommend others who can also be studied by the researchers, so as to gain as many participants as possible. It is critical for the chosen sampling method to suit the needs of the research being conducted.

Based on the passage, researchers use availability sampling when it is important to

A.	define the specific population being studied.
B.	select participants based on their accessibility.
C.	randomly select participants from a population.

For supplies, you will need glass jars with lids, a wooden spoon or spatula, and a saucepan. Before beginning the preserving process, the glass jars should be sanitized to prevent mold and bacterial contamination. Also, they should be kept warm to avoid cracking, due to temperature differences, when the jam is added. The next steps are to combine the fruit, pectin, and sugar into the saucepan, then slightly mash the fruit until the texture becomes chunky. Once the mixture is prepared, set the saucepan on the stove to boil at a medium heat. While cooking, the pectin combines with the fruit and sugar to create a gel-like consistency. A slice of lemon, rind included, can be used in place of store-bought pectin. After the bubbles from the boiling mixture become smaller and thicker, the jam has set and is ready to be jarred.

Based on the passage, what should happen immediately after mashing the fruit?

A.	Sterilize the glass jars.
B.	Combine all ingredients.
C.	Cook the mixture at a medium heat.
D.	Add a slice of lemon to the mixture.

Spilsbury cut wooden maps into pieces to create a teaching tool for children of royalty to learn geography. In the 1800s, puzzles like these began to be made using a foot-powered saw with a fine blade. This method allowed more complicated wooden shapes to be cut, and the name “jigsaw puzzle” was born. Simultaneously, the pictures on the expensive puzzles evolved from educational themes to pure entertainment, and became a parlor game for affluent adults. During the Great Depression, manufacturers began to mass produce puzzles using cardboard, instead of wood. This brought down the price and made puzzles widely affordable. The puzzle market soon greatly expanded, and family members were able to enjoy assembling them together as an inexpensive pastime. A wide variety of jigsaw puzzles are now available, including those made virtually using computer software.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	The earliest puzzles appealed mostly to adults.
B.	Spilsbury’s puzzles were made of simple shapes.
C.	The Great Depression popularized puzzles of maps.

He was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her, though he went without his dinner.

Everyone knows that language is variable. Two individuals of the same generation and locality, speaking precisely the same dialect and moving in the same social circles, are never absolutely at one in their speech habits. A minute investigation of the speech of each individual would reveal countless differences of detail -- in choice of words, in sentence structure, in the relative frequency with which particular forms or combinations of words are used, in the pronunciation of particular vowels and consonants and of combinations of vowels and consonants, in all those features, such as speed, stress, and tone, that give life to spoken language. In a sense they speak slightly divergent dialects of the same language rather than identically the same language.

In discussing language, the author’s primary focus is on

A.	the distinctly different dialects within every language.
B.	the idea that variation exists within a single language.
C.	how spoken words influence written language.
D.	great variations in how words are pronounced.

His writings were influential and had large followings among both scholars and general readers during the late 19th to early 20th century. Bergson’s most renowned works include Time and Free Will, which presented his groundbreaking interpretation of consciousness, and Matter and Memory, which further developed his ideas about consciousness as the connection between mind and body. Bergson won the 1927 Nobel Prize for Literature for his brilliant ideas and the skillful way with which he presented his texts, utilizing literary techniques of analogy, imagery, and metaphor. Though Bergson’s readership saw a decline post-World War II as compared to previous years, Bergson’s ingenious ideas were important contributions to the study of fundamental ideas about truth and life.

Cease to think of Britain's naval power in terms of battleships and cruisers and you begin to understand it. Think of it rather in terms of trade routes and navigation, of ship and dockyards, of busy ports and harbors, of a deeply indented coast line, 7,000 miles in length; of great rivers flowing into wide estuaries; of liners and tramps; weatherly east coast trawlers and burly Penzance luggers; of ancient fishing villages looking out from every bay and rocky inlet. Built by nature to be the home of a maritime people, inhabited by the descendants of sea-faring races, accessible only from other lands by water, every stone in the British Isles is fitted into a geographical foundation.

The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.

The marine iguana is the only type of iguana that swims in the ocean, and its diet primarily consists of algae that grows in the ocean and on wet rocks. The youngest iguanas feed on algae growing closest to the shore, while the larger iguanas swim into the salty ocean waters to get the algae that is harder to reach. In order to cope with their salty environment, marine iguanas have a complex nasal system that allows them to sneeze out the excess salt in their diets. The iguanas do not typically dive very deeply into the ocean or swim for more than a few minutes, but some have been observed to remain underwater for almost half an hour. After a chilly swim, the marine iguanas climb out of the water onto the warm rocks and bask in the heat to get their body temperature back to normal.

According to the passage, which of the following is a common behavior of marine iguanas?

The making of this lacquerware begins with a hand-carved product, such as a wooden bowl, which is then covered with a liquid derived from tree sap, the lacquer. Once the lacquer has hardened, the bowl is polished to remove blemishes, and another layer of lacquer is added. The processes of lacquering and polishing are repeated until the surface is completely smooth. Some pieces then have designs carved into them, which are filled with gold leaf and covered with even more lacquer. Artisans work in specially sealed rooms for the final applications of lacquer, which are brushed onto the piece only after all surface dust has been wiped away. These rooms maintain the proper temperature and humidity, and keep out particles that may mar the outermost lacquer layers. Creating a high quality piece of lacquerware in this way can take more than a year and involve over 35 steps.

According to the passage, what do artisans do immediately before applying the final layers of lacquer to a piece?

Honey’s thick texture and high sugar content make it a popular ingredient in many foods. In combination with these properties, the low moisture and high acidity of honey make it helpful in soothing coughs, slowing the growth of foodborne bacteria, and helping wounds heal. A few precautions must be taken before consuming honey, however. Infants under a year old, due to their immature immune systems, should not eat unpasteurized honey to avoid risk of contracting botulism, a serious condition that can be caused by bacteria found in honey. Also, honey made from certain sources, such as rhododendron pollen, can be poisonous, causing nausea and dizziness. As with any food item, it is important to be aware of the risks of honey before consuming it.

For this project, we will use electroluminescent (EL) material to give the appearance of sunlight streaming in through our “window.” First, buy the EL panel, a flexible, plastic sheet with a coating that emits light when electricity flows through it. Next, purchase window blinds sized to be slightly wider and longer than your EL panel. Choose where on the wall you want to install the window, and ensure it is near an electrical outlet. Carefully mark the wall with a pencil to indicate the edges of the EL panel, using a level to ensure that the vertical lines are plumb. Position the EL panel along the pencil lines, and mount it to the wall using adhesive. Install the window blinds, and plug in the EL panel, opening or closing the blinds to let in the right amount of light. A faux window project takes more effort than simply hanging a piece of art, but the effect is definitely worth it!

Despite being a bird, the creature prefers to run rather than fly and can reach speeds of up to 18 miles per hour doing so. An efficient predator, this roadrunner seeks out rattlesnakes, lizards, and mice to eat, though occasionally it also eats fruit. If the bird senses a threat, it may fly to a hiding place in a quick burst of energy, but its flights usually consist only of glides between perching places. Roadrunners are preyed upon by coyotes, which run twice as fast. Adapted to life in dry climates, the birds don’t need to find drinking water for survival because they obtain adequate fluids from eating their prey. Additionally, roadrunners reduce water loss by concentrating salt from their bodies into a solution that is secreted from a special gland near their eyes.

According to the passage, which of the following is a normal activity for the greater roadrunner?

For her accomplishments, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in both physics and chemistry. Following this success, Curie received funding to establish an institute with two laboratories, one led by her for research in her fields and one led by a physician to research medical applications of radioactivity. When World War I interrupted the institute’s research, Curie actively promoted the medical use of radiation to x-ray injured soldiers by helping to procure equipment and train volunteers in its use. Curie died in 1934 from a bone marrow disease caused by exposure to radioactivity. Nearly a century after her work, her books and papers are so radioactive they must be stored in lead-lined boxes. Curie’s scientific breakthroughs are still celebrated, and the institute she helped found continues her scientific legacy.

According to the passage, Marie Curie obtained equipment during World War I to

A.	train volunteers.
B.	x-ray injured soldiers.
C.	research medical uses of radiation.

Known for its long, horn-like tusk, this arctic whale is also aptly called the “unicorn of the sea.” The narwhal tusk is actually a tooth that grows throughout the whale’s life and can reach close to nine feet in length. Based solely on the appearance of the elongated tooth, one might guess that it is a tool for penetrating ice in the whale’s native waters, or a defensive weapon against predators. Because the tusk grows predominantly on males, some scientists speculate that the primary purpose relates to breeding. Further research to support this idea is needed, though narwhals have been observed sparring with their tusks to win females, and males with broken tusks and one male with a portion of a tusk in its skull have been found. Another suggestion is that the tusk is a sensory organ that can interpret the chemical nature of the water, helping the narwhal find food and female mates.

According to the passage, male narwhals with broken tusks may be evidence that the elongated tooth is used to

A.	pierce the frozen ocean surface.
B.	win battles to earn rights to mate.
C.	detect changes in ocean chemistry.
D.	defend against attacking predators.

The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage. The wind, obstinately remaining in the north-west, blew a gale, and retarded the steamer. The Rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long, monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path. A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November, the squall knocking the vessel about with fury, and the waves running high. The Rangoon reefed all her sails, and even the rigging proved too much, whistling and shaking amid the squall. The steamer was forced to proceed slowly, and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time, and more if the storm lasted.

The term “dieting” is not synonymous with deprivation, and dieting need not be difficult or expensive; it can be adopted with little effort and can be a positive step towards sustained health. Dieting can take on many forms, some of them negative, but the idea of avoiding excessive amounts of food with little nutritional value is clearly beneficial. A good diet involves eliminating highly processed foods with many additives, increasing intake of fresh food items that suit your tastes and budget, and choosing foods that fit your personal health profile, which may include high blood pressure or diabetes. Very restrictive diets are usually hard to stick with over time, and may not be truly healthy. However, anybody with enough commitment and dedication to adopting healthy eating habits can maintain an appropriate diet.

Based on the passage, the author’s attitude towards eating a proper diet is

A.	arrogant.

The ingredients for nutritious compost, the end product of this process, can be found in your own household. First, find a bin that will hold all of the materials for your compost. Then, in the bin, gather a combination of brown plant matter, such as dry leaves or shredded newspapers, and green plant matter, such as fruit or vegetable scraps. After a short few days, the combined organic materials will begin to break down. While the materials are decomposing, make sure to fold or stir them around every week or so and also check that they are moist, but not wet. Occasionally adding more green plant matter will keep a consistent level of moisture, if you notice the materials are drying out. The process is complete and the compost is ready to use when the broken down materials resemble rich, dark soil rather than rotting plants.

Based on the passage, what should be done after turning over the organic materials?

A.	Transfer the compost to a larger bin.
B.	Add more brown plant matter.
C.	Add more green plant matter.

This was after Charles Cretors patented the mobile steam-powered popcorn machine, which allowed popcorn to be produced and sold by street vendors. The tantalizing aroma combined with its cheap price made popcorn a popular treat, especially through the Great Depression, when movie theater owners installed popcorn machines to boost profits for their struggling businesses. Popcorn remained a favorite in theaters during World War II, because sweet snacks were difficult to come by due to sugar rationing. Today, popcorn continues to be as much a part of theaters as the movies themselves.

Percy Spencer was building magnetrons, devices used to generate microwaves for radar sets, when he noticed that the candy in his pocket had melted. To investigate this issue further, he and some colleagues decided to test a few more objects. The next attempts included popcorn and an egg that exploded and hit the face of a co-worker. Spencer then made a metal box to contain the microwave radiation from the magnetrons, thus allowing for more control of the heat and safety of his experiment. Items he placed in the box were heated, leading Spencer’s company to file for a patent for the microwave oven! It wasn’t until a couple decades later, however, that microwave ovens were small and priced for home use. Since then, tens of millions of microwave ovens have been sold and used.

While Seeberger registered a trademark for the name, the escalator’s invention is attributed to several different people. The first two, Nathan Ames in 1859 and Leamon Souder in 1889, had their designs patented but never built. In 1896, Jesse Reno built the first device to elevate passengers, but it was more of a conveyor belt than an inclined set of moving stairs. George H. Wheeler, another inventor with a patent but no product, sold his design to Seeberger, who combined their ideas. The escalator as we know it today was the result of that design, built in 1899 by Seeberger and his employer, an elevator company.

The structure of wood affords the only reliable means of distinguishing the different kinds. Color, weight, smell, and other appearances, which are often direct or indirect results of structure, may be helpful in this distinction, but cannot be relied upon entirely. Furthermore, structure underlies nearly all the technical properties of this important product, and furnishes an explanation why one piece differs in these properties from another. Structure explains why oak is heavier, stronger, and tougher than pine; why it is harder to saw and plane, and why it is so much more difficult to season without injury. From its less porous structure alone it is evident that a piece of young and thrifty oak is stronger than the porous wood of an old or stunted tree, or that a Georgia or long-leaf pine excels white pine in weight and strength.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

A.	Wood from young trees is heavier than wood from old trees.

As a child Sullivan was poor, nearly blind, and unable to read or write. Sullivan was already a teenager when she was given the opportunity to start attending a school for the blind in Massachusetts. Despite being ridiculed for her impoverished upbringing, she thrived at the school, and when she was twenty years old, graduated as valedictorian. Shortly thereafter, Sullivan was hired as a tutor for Helen Keller, a blind, deaf, and rebellious little girl living in Alabama. Keller excelled under Sullivan’s tutelage, and the two became inseparable. Anne Sullivan even accompanied Keller to college. After Keller’s graduation, she and Sullivan worked together to raise money for blind foundations across America.

However, the cute, playful animals they see were once hunted for their fur, almost to the point of extinction. Sea otter numbers are rebounding, but slowly, because they give birth to only one pup in a litter. Sea otters are still considered a threatened species, and it will be some time before their numbers bounce back to pre-hunting days when the entire West Coast was crowded with otters. These animals are intricately tied to the underwater ecosystem that develops within the kelp forest; sometimes literally, as they grab hold of the kelp while they are resting to keep from floating out to sea. The otters eat the snails and urchins that feed on the kelp, which helps keep the kelp forests healthy and thriving. Without the otters, California’s delicate coastal ecosystem would be thrown out of balance.

According to the passage, it is a slow process for sea otters to keep increasing in number because they

This bioluminescence is caused by a chemical reaction that creates the most efficient light in the world, converting nearly 100 percent of the energy from the chemical reaction into light and losing just a tiny amount as heat. Fireflies use this glow to attract mates and to ward off predators. Each species has its own light-flashing pattern. Males of some species have the ability to mimic the light-flashing pattern of other firefly species in order to trick the females that are drawn to the emitted light. The eggs of some firefly species are also known to emit light as a way to protect themselves. However, not all adult fireflies can produce light; fireflies in the western United States particularly lack the ability to glow.

However, pit bulls, along with Doberman pinschers, German shepherds, and rottweilers, were historically bred to be aggressive, and that legacy has unjustly followed them into the present day. Like all dogs, these breeds cannot be judged strictly on their genetics, as there are many behavioral differences within every breed. Also, the proper obedience training and socialization of dogs of any breed can be necessary to help manage aggressive tendencies. Slowly, these feared breeds are shedding their reputations as dangerous dogs and, with the assistance of responsible breeding, are becoming more readily accepted as potentially wonderful pets.

The author most likely wrote the passage about breeds with a reputation for violence in order to

Many aspects of modern sumo are based on Shinto, an indigenous religious practice, and involve symbolism. After entering the ring, the circular area on a raised platform where the bout occurs, each wrestler takes part in a ceremony meant to purify his body and spirit. First, the wrestlers toss salt around the sand-covered ring as an act of purification, and then they engage in a series of movements lasting several minutes. They clap their hands, lift their palms up to the sky, and stamp their feet on the ground -- symbolic acts to dispel any evil spirits lurking in the ring. The fighting itself, which requires strength and balance and may last just seconds, begins only after these rituals have been conducted. The bout concludes when a wrestler is either grappled off the ring or touches the ground with any part of his body other than his feet.

Casually referred to as the “good” bacteria, probiotics is the name scientists give to a group of microorganisms that are known to be beneficial, in particular to your digestive system. These bacteria live naturally in your body, but the same or similar strains also occur in fermented foods such as yogurt. Scientists agree that certain strains of probiotics can help food move through the digestive system. And to relieve symptoms of some digestive diseases, adding probiotics to a prescription drug treatment plan can be effective. Though preliminary research suggests that other health concerns, such as allergies, poor oral health, and skin problems, might be aided by probiotic supplements, studies are not yet definitive.

One reason the ocean looks blue is because water absorbs the red colors in the light spectrum, leaving only the blue colors visible to our eyes. As light penetrates deeper into the ocean, more colors are filtered out; very little light penetrates more than 656 feet, and no light exists deeper than 3,280 feet. Another reason the ocean may appear blue in color is that particles in the water act as tiny mirrors reflecting the color of the sky. But the ocean may look gray, green, or red depending on the type and quantity of particles in the sea that are acting as reflectors. Areas of the Atlantic Ocean usually appear green because of algae and other plants living in the water. And where a river empties into the sea, the water will appear brown because of the sediment that is mixed in.

As a nation bordered by the sea, Sweden has an abundance of seafood, which is the mainstay of its people’s diet and plays an important role in its culture. A prime example of this is the transformation of herring from fresh to rotten to create the pungent surstromming. Small herring are caught in springtime, salted, and then fermented before being packed into cans. Fermentation continues in the pressurized can for about a month. Once taken out of the can, the fermented fish is commonly served in an open-faced sandwich with butter, potatoes, red onions, and other condiments to help temper its sharp taste. Connoisseurs of surstromming prefer to eat the previous year’s canned catch, which has greater tenderness and a more mature flavor.

One such dish is bird’s nest soup, which is literally made from nests harvested from remote cliffs or caves in Southeast Asia. The nests, built by a particular swallow native to these regions, are made of dried, hardened bird saliva and bits of other organic material. The edible nest has been valued for centuries in China as a medicinal food, although scientific evidence to support such claims is scarce or nonexistent. The main components of the bird’s nest have little flavor, which is why the traditional version of the soup was prepared with sugar.

Although there are a few cases of peoples who have no contact with any other languages, these pockets are diminishing. When smaller groups of people are surrounded by a larger group that speaks another language, the smaller groups have little choice but to adopt the language of the larger group to work and trade effectively. Many see this as tragic, because language can often sustain a group’s cultural identity. Stories, expressions, songs, and words develop over generations and are integral to a specific language. And in contrast to the relative ease of recovering the seeds of an endangered plant, efforts to document an oral language require the direct recording of living speakers, many of whom are elderly.

But you can turn this thinking around by imagining the numerous benefits budgeting can provide. For example, you can relax later if you know you have set aside funds for unexpected events and vacations, and you may experience less tension in your relationships and avoid arguments about money by planning how you will pay bills. Taking charge of your future financial success by determining how much to save will bring you peace of mind.

When people buy recycled paper products such as paper towels, chances are they believe those products consist only of paper that was previously used, then collected and processed to make the product they just bought. However, this is not always the case, and labels can be confusing. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), paper that is labeled with the term “recycled” must contain 100% post-consumer recovered fiber, meaning it was made entirely from paper that was thrown away and recycled after someone had used it. In contrast, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, whose jurisdiction overlaps that of the EPA with respect to environmental labeling, allows a product to be labeled “recycled content” paper when the product contains less than 100% post-consumer content. To ease the confusion, consumers can focus on the percentage of post-consumer material in a product: the higher it is, the fewer resources have been used to create it, making it a more environmentally friendly option.

Ginger can be found in recipes for foods as diverse as cookies and fish cakes, and it is an ingredient in beverages -- like ginger ale. When used medicinally, the root is dried and ground into a powder or juiced. It is taken primarily to relieve nausea and inflammation, but some people apply the juice directly to burns to relieve pain. Because a side effect of ginger is that it can slow the formation of blood clots, taking it along with other medications that act as blood thinners is not recommended. Some of the medicinal benefits of this root are believed to be tied to its chemical compound, gingerol, which may reduce inflammation by eliminating free radicals, chemicals that can damage cell components. Ginger likely owes its popularity to its potential health properties as well as to its unique taste.

The boats are called gondolas, and the people powering them are gondoliers. Because Venice has canals where most other cities have roads, all kinds of boats, including the gondola, are plentiful. The gondolas are narrow and have shallow bottoms, making them suitable to navigate the maze of tight waterways. Being a gondolier was traditionally a family trade, and skills were passed down from generation to generation. Today, a gondolier license must be obtained by passing a test that requires demonstrating knowledge of Venetian culture and landmarks, in addition to the ability to maneuver the boat.

Sunlight is completely blocked at these depths, so there is no way for sea plants to grow. But life has found a way to exist in these places. In the absence of solar energy, which is needed for photosynthesis, bacteria growing near these hydrothermal vents can create energy from chemicals in the water, using a process called chemosynthesis. These bacteria are the basis of the food chain for the larger animals in this ecosystem. The hydrothermal vents are not easy places to inhabit; creatures must be able to withstand total darkness, high temperatures and pressures, and toxic chemicals in the water. Yet quite a few species have adapted to such conditions, forming an ecosystem found nowhere else on Earth.

In societies all over the world, there are social and economic reasons that cause people to increase the use of a small number of majority languages, such as English, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic, and to reduce the use of their native, minority languages. It may be beneficial to speak the majority language of a geographic area in order to succeed in a career, or it may be that education is only taught in the majority language. Learning a minority language requires a significant investment of effort and time, but doing so will help preserve cultural traditions that might otherwise be lost. Though speaking the majority language enables children to talk with many others outside their community, speaking only that language limits effective communication with their parents and other ancestors.

According to the passage, learning a minority language can be useful to help

A.	succeed in a career.
B.	obtain an education.
C.	communicate globally.
D.	preserve cultural traditions.

When you begin to sleep, you are first briefly in a stage between sleep and wakefulness, or light sleep. You might awaken to noises, or even experience a feeling of tripping and wake yourself up. During the second stage of sleep, your body lies mostly still, your heart rate is regular, and your body temperature decreases. This is followed by deep sleep, when your body does the most growing and repairing. Your heart rate is at its lowest during this stage, and if your sleep cycle is interrupted, you will feel disoriented for a while. The last stage is REM sleep, when your heart rate and temperature increase back to levels similar to when you are awake, and your brain becomes active. You experience this brain activity as dreaming. Because sleeping is a cycle, after REM sleep ends, the next cycle begins again with light sleep.

According to the passage, what happens just before the dreaming stage of sleep?

A.	The feeling of falling can occur.
B.	The heart beats at its lowest rate.
C.	The body temperature begins to decrease.
D.	The eyes begin moving rapidly back and forth.

The habitat of one lemur species, the Alaotran lemur, is near the lake for which it is named, Lake Alaotra. All lemurs share certain features, such as having moist noses and a furry coat and using their teeth for grooming, but Lake Alaotra lemurs have several distinct characteristics. These lemurs live in a marshy environment among the papyrus reeds on the lakeshore, whereas most lemur species, except for the ground dwelling ring-tailed, live among trees. Leaping from reed to reed, only Lake Alaotra lemurs use all four of their limbs to navigate their way above the water. Lake Alaotra lemurs eat only papyrus, grasses, and reed stems, in contrast with other lemur species that include a greater variety of foods in their diet. Madagascar has lost about 16 species of lemurs due to hunting and other human activity, and conservation efforts are in progress to protect remaining lemur populations from extinction.

According to the passage, which of the following statements about Lake Alaotra lemurs is correct?

A.	They are agile swimmers.

Instead, the brain operates efficiently by storing key details of an event in a summarized form, and building the rest of a memory out of general knowledge and expectations. When people try to recall what they had for dinner a week earlier, for example, the first things that come to mind relate to prior experiences of what dinner is, where they tend to eat it, with whom, and what they like to eat. It is possible for memory to be wrong, because certain details can be replaced with more generic information. Studies have shown that when people are asked to imagine an event, they sometimes later remember that event as a real occurrence. Imagining and remembering are similar processes in the brain, and the source of a piece of information may be forgotten. A person might, for example, hear a story several times and later remember the events of the story as if they were first-hand experience.

Which of the following statements about memory is suggested by the passage?

A.	People with vivid imaginations are superior at recalling real events.

Ventriloquists use techniques to avoid moving their lips when they talk, and they also get help from the brains of their audience members. Most people rely heavily on visual cues in determining the source of sounds they hear, and the senses of hearing and sight send information to the same area of the brain. Thus, when an audience member sees the moving mouth of a ventriloquist dummy during an act, that person associates the dummy’s mouth with the voice heard, without thinking about it consciously. Similarly, when people watch movies in a theater, they have the experience of hearing voices coming directly from the mouths of the characters they are watching on screen, even though the sounds are actually emanating from audio speakers that may be distant from the screen. Voices can even seem to be louder when listeners are looking at the mouth of the person who is speaking, because the visual input to the brain is processed right alongside the auditory input.

Which of the following best restates the author’s main point?

A.	Ventriloquists owe their success to visual tricks.

She began her writing career by submitting articles to the Pittsburgh Dispatch, covering not fashion or gardening but unfair labor laws and other issues of social justice under the pen name Nellie Bly. After spending six months in Mexico as a foreign correspondent, where she reported on political corruption, Cochrane was hired at The New York World. There, she went undercover to a mental institution to expose cruel practices. Her disclosures led to institutional reforms, and her approach to reporting continued to follow similar tactics. She operated undercover in a jail and in a sweatshop to reveal the poor conditions in those locations. Her most famous activity of all, however, was her trip around the world in 72 days, a feat that was eagerly read about by thousands of fans. Cochrane broke convention at every turn, and in the process created lasting changes to the perception of women in journalism.

The puppets, traditionally made out of water buffalo leather, are illuminated from behind to create silhouettes on a screen; the effect is an ethereal and beautiful spectacle. Wayang kulit performances mark special times of gathering for Javanese communities. The stories told are epics that have withstood the test of time and teach moral lessons while also captivating audiences young and old. The storyteller, or dalang, operates the puppets with both hands while animatedly acting out the tale with musical help from an orchestra. Dalang are well respected in Javanese culture and are renowned for their ability to discuss local events and even diplomatically suggest solutions to contemporary social problems through the medium of storytelling. Moreover, the dalang accomplish this without taking any breaks; these incredible performances last all night until dawn.

What is most likely the author’s purpose in writing the passage?

As members of the vulture family, they feed on carrion, meaning dead animals. The Andean condor inhabits South America and has a status of “near threatened,” so it is close to becoming endangered. The California condor in North America is in even worse condition, with only about two hundred birds currently in existence. This species nearly faced extinction in the 1980s for several reasons, including lead poisoning and the illegal collection of its rare eggs. In the early 1990s, the two dozen remaining condors were placed in captivity by the U.S. government for protection, and their offspring were introduced into the wild. These actions are leading to the slow regrowth of the population. 

According to the passage, what do Andean and California condors have in common?

1831.	The aurora borealis and the aurora australis, or Northern Lights and Southern Lights, are awe-inspiring displays of shimmering multicolored lights in the night sky. Though numerous stories from ancient peoples and times recount the origins of auroras, there is a scientific explanation. Solar storms release bursts of electrically charged particles or ions into space from the Sun. Most of those particles don’t make it past the magnetic fields around Earth, but at the magnetic poles of Earth, the fields are weaker and allow some ions to reach Earth’s atmosphere. The varying colors of light are a direct result of different gas particles in the atmosphere, such as oxygen and nitrogen, colliding with the ions. The hue of the aurora similarly depends on the altitude of the collisions, because the composition of Earth’s atmosphere varies at different altitudes. The “dancing” movement of the lights is created by the dynamic nature of the collisions.

According to the passage, the specific colors in auroras are determined by

A.	the strength of Earth’s magnetic field.
B.	how many ions reach Earth’s atmosphere.
C.	the size of the ions emitted by the solar storm.

The resulting pool of water underground can dissolve soluble bedrock such as limestone or chalk, creating cracks, cavities, and caverns. As a cavity grows, the surface layer of ground becomes unstable and will, eventually, collapse. This process could be gradual, as it is with cover-subsidence sinkholes, or it could be sudden, as with cover-collapse sinkholes. When the latter occurs, the thin surface layer above a cavern crumbles, suddenly collapsing the ground and any structures upon it. There are warning signs that an area is about to collapse. For example, the ground will slightly sink and cause trees around it to look slanted, and buildings or roads will show cracks. Scientists can produce detailed maps to identify where soluble rock is located, thus helping to reduce risk of damage to life and property from sinkholes.

According to the passage, sinkholes begin to develop when

A.	a large cavern undermines a road.

Though these mites may cause allergic reactions with annoying symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, signs of asthma, and itchy skin, they do not harm humans by biting or stinging. It is impossible to completely rid a home of dust mites, but by vacuuming frequently, washing bedding in hot water, using allergen-impermeable encasements, and finding ways to reduce humidity inside your home, you can decrease their quantity. Actions such as these will help to reduce the incidence of allergic reactions.

The yeast converts the sugar into usable energy during a process called fermentation. This process generates flavorful acids as well as carbon dioxide gas, which creates little bubbles in the bread dough. In addition to making the dough rise, the bubbling helps the proteins in dough connect with each other and with water molecules to give the bread its structure. Chilling the dough before the sugar is used up will slow the growth of yeast and allow other microorganisms that produce tasty acids to flourish, resulting in the addition of new and different flavors to the bread.

According to the passage, what action can hinder yeast from growing in bread dough?

A.	decreasing dough temperature
B.	reducing bubbles in the dough

In perfect harmony with the principles that ordered his life, the owner of the castle made great show of hospitality at times. But the recipients of his effusive welcome were invariably those from whom, or through whom, he had reason to think he might derive a definite material gain in return for his graciousness. The chief entertainment offered these occasional utilitarian guests was a verbal catalogue of the estate, with an itemized statement of the cost of everything mentioned. If the architecture of the house was noticed, Adam [the owner] proudly disclaimed any knowledge of architecture, but named the architect's fee, and gave the building cost in detail, from the heating system to the window screens.

For example, lead-based pigments have an opaque quality that allows an artist to use just a small amount instead of having to build up several layers of paint, and they can be used to produce paints prized for their vivid color. In the past, both fine artists and house painters could enjoy the durability of paints made with the pigment “white lead,” which doesn’t dissolve in water and also helps a coating of paint avoid cracking. During the twentieth century, however, many countries passed laws limiting or banning lead’s commercial use in household paints or on toys because of the toxicity of lead, which may damage health if it gets into the bloodstream. One side effect of the regulations was lower availability and higher costs for legal oil paints that contain lead for artists’ use. An alternative is for artists to make white lead paint from scratch by following a messy and multi-step recipe that calls for lead, vinegar, manure, and time.

Which of the following statements about lead-based paint is suggested by the passage?

Someone has said that if our attention is properly trained we should be able “to look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour without winking.” But this is a false idea of attention. The ability to look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour might indicate a very laudable power of concentration; but the process, instead of enlightening us concerning the point of the needle, would result in our passing into a hypnotic state. Voluntary attention to any one object can be sustained for but a brief time -- a few seconds at best. It is essential that the object change, that we turn it over and over incessantly, and consider its various aspects and relations. Sustained voluntary attention is thus a repetition of successive efforts to bring back the object to the mind. Then the subject grows and develops -- it is living, not dead.

The lens lay on the table, ready to be placed upon its platform. My hand fairly shook as I enveloped a drop of water with a thin coating of oil of turpentine, preparatory to its examination, a process necessary in order to prevent the rapid evaporation of the water. I now placed the drop on a thin slip of glass under the lens, and throwing upon it, by the combined aid of a prism and a mirror, a powerful stream of light, I approached my eye to the minute hole drilled through the axis of the lens. For an instant I saw nothing save what seemed to be an illuminated chaos, a vast, luminous abyss. A pure white light, cloudless and serene, and seemingly limitless as space itself, was my first impression. Gently, and with the greatest care, I depressed the lens a few hairbreadths. The wondrous illumination still continued, but as the lens approached the object a scene of indescribable beauty was unfolded to my view.

Preserving through pickling or another method also allows foods that spoil quickly, such as fish, to be available for a longer term. To pickle a food, it is placed in vinegar or another substance that will maintain or create high acidity. The acidic environment prevents the growth of bacteria that cause food to spoil. Cultures around the world use a variety of substances to pickle their foods. In the U.S., cucumbers are kept in a salt water mixture. In Japan, some vegetables are dry-pickled in rice bran, a powdered part of rice grain. In China, a popular form of pickling involves vegetables, such as lettuce hearts, being stored in a sweet-and-salty soy sauce mixture.

After the plants start to flower, it is time to hand pollinate them. When small green pumpkins appear, the next critical step is to quickly choose the right candidate for each plant -- the pumpkin with a round shape, whose stem is growing directly away from the vine. Then, all the other pumpkins must be detached from that vine, allowing nutrients to be dedicated completely to the single remaining pumpkin. Next, the vine has to be monitored carefully, and all new stems that sprout must be removed. Finally, the pumpkin has to be watered generously, and fed fertilizer at a rate of about 1 pound per week. Pumpkins can grow up to 2 inches per night, but if they grow too fast they can burst, so consistency is essential. With luck, a prize-worthy giant pumpkin will result in just a few months.

Though wild Gros Michel bananas have seeds, the plants also grow shoots of new plants directly from their stems. Planting the shoots created a new plant faster than planting a seed, and generated banana plants that were clones of the original plant. The clones were mostly beneficial and made the schedule of banana growth and ripening predictable. But there is a lethal downside to this approach. If a few plants contract a disease, the disease can become widespread because every plant is genetically the same, without the possible resistance that could come from genetic variation. This happened when a fungus infected the Gros Michel banana plantations, which shut down due to plant losses. As of 1958, the Cavendish banana, resistant to the fungus, became the successor to the Gros Michel in the commercial banana market.

Bantam chickens, for example, emit a rapid, high-pitched clucking if they see a dangerous animal approach on the ground. However, if they see a hawk or another bird of prey overhead they give a prolonged shrill call. If there are no other bantams around when predators are near, bantams are much less likely to make any alarm call. A bantam is likely to make single clucks when it notices food; whether it’s a male who wants to direct a female’s attention to the food, or a female who wants to direct her chicks’ attention to the food. Bantams react appropriately to the calls, as well. For example, they will look low and moving toward open space, prepared to fly, when a rapid ground-danger call is heard. Next time you hear a chicken clucking, it might just be warning other chickens about you.

Some people, including Admiral Grace Hopper, believed computers would become more useful -- for example, by performing tasks such as automatic billing -- if it were possible to communicate with them using English. In 1949, Hopper and her staff developed FLOW-MATIC, which translated English statements into mathematical symbols. At first, the system only understood twenty English commands, and it took several years before Hopper convinced her colleagues, who doubted it was possible, that the system could be expanded to build an entire programming language. In 1959, Hopper and her team published the initial details of COBOL, the first programming language.

A seemingly part-human, part-animal figure was also found, which has generated numerous theories to explain its potentially mythical meaning. The paintings of animals are plentiful, with depictions of them falling into two categories. The first, according to analysis of the bones and other evidence left in the caves, are of animals hunted and eaten by the cave painters. The second category of animals are likely those that were dangerous to humans, rather than preyed upon by humans, such as lions, cave bears, and mammoths. Some archaeologists believe that these animal images symbolized strength and were painted as part of a ritual to gain the powers of the animals themselves. Regardless of their meaning, the paintings are magnificent and considered to be some of the earliest examples of human artistic endeavors.

Surprisingly, though bamboo stalks can reach heights of more than 130 feet, they are still classified as a type of grass. Also remarkable is the number of uses this plant has. In certain Asian cuisines, bamboo seeds are eaten as a grain. Young bamboo shoots can be eaten as vegetables, though they must be boiled to remove the cyanide that is poisonous to humans. Additionally, bamboo fiber can be used in fabrics, and bamboo stalks serve as construction material for houses, furniture, and flag poles. Besides its variety of uses, bamboo can be environmentally beneficial because it does not take many resources to grow and can prevent erosion by stabilizing the soil.

According to the passage, what parts of the bamboo plant are boiled to remove poisonous cyanide?

A.	shoots
B.	leaves
C.	stalks

It has a reddish-brown or gray color and a nose that looks a bit like a pig’s, hence its name. This species of bat can be found in forests and limestone caves in certain regions of Thailand and Myanmar. A cave colony can have as few as 10 bats, or as many as 500, but the average is about 100 bats. Just before dawn and soon after the sun sets, these tiny creatures can be seen zipping along in search of insects, which they find through echolocation -- a method of locating objects through reflected sound waves. The bats catch and eat their prey while hovering in mid-air, in preparation for snaring the next insect. Hog-nosed bats hunt for only 20 to 30 minutes at a time, and they typically stay within 1,000 meters of home when foraging for a meal.

According to the passage, what is the average number of hog-nosed bats that live together in a cave?

This huge coral reef ecosystem evolved over thousands of years. Living amid the hundreds of islands today are approximately 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of coral, 240 species of birds, and many marine mammals. Blue-green algae and red algae are plentiful and play a major role in recycling nutrients. Protected by law, dugongs, marine turtles, sea birds, and seahorses are just a few of the numerous species that are managed carefully to guard against their extinction. This is a truly spectacular place to observe natural scenery, and tourists flock here to witness the underwater life through glass-bottomed boats or up close by scuba diving. Visiting the Great Barrier Reef is a once-in-a-lifetime experience not to be missed.

According to the passage, which of the following statements about the Great Barrier Reef is correct?

A.	Because the number of species is low, the population of each species living there is high.
B.	Though the number of species living there is high, the population of each species is low.

Although they don’t survive in places with freezing temperatures, these hardy trees are able to survive despite several conditions -- constant flooding from incoming tides, low-oxygen soil, and a water source that has a high salt content -- that would destroy many other plants. Mangroves absorb oxygen through roots extended above water, exposing the roots to the air for parts of the day when the tides ebb. To cope with the salty water of their environment, these trees extract freshwater from the ocean, filtering as much as 90 percent of the ocean water’s salt through its roots. Mangrove trees are also remarkable because they provide an ecosystem for a wide variety of plants and animal species such as algae, crocodiles, and crabs.

Clams, oysters, mussels, and other mollusks cover the intruding particle with layers of aragonite (a mineral) and conchiolin (a protein) that are also used to form the pearl’s outer layer. Over time, these layers encircle the particle to create a pearl. Though the first image that may come to mind when one envisions a pearl is a perfect sphere, naturally grown pearls are rarely found in this shape. Even farm-grown pearls’ shapes are difficult to predict because there are a wide variety of factors that have an effect on the resulting form, such as the condition of the water, location of the particle inside the mollusk, or the mollusk’s health. In the exceptional occasion that a perfectly round, true pearl is found, it is sure to fetch a high price.

According to the passage, the value of a pearl depends on

If the hole is small -- about the size of a doorknob -- just a few materials are necessary to make a quick do-it-yourself repair. A self-adhesive mesh patch, putty knife, joint compound or any filler material with a mud-like consistency, sand paper, and paint are all the supplies that are needed to begin the process. Simply seal the adhesive patch over the hole and then use the putty knife to evenly slather on the joint compound over the patch. Reapply the joint compound as needed and after the area is dried, use the sand paper to smooth out any rough areas. Using paint that matches the wall color, paint over the patch. With just a little effort, the wall should look just like it did before.

At last the long-looked-for letter came that father and brother had arrived in the mines of California, and in the letter were several small flakes of gold wrapped in a bit of paper. We had so long hoped against hope that the sight of the familiar writing caused the greatest excitement. Poor mother could hardly hold out any longer and the news was too much for her weak body, for she was just convalescing from weeks of sickness brought on by hope deferred and waiting and watching each day for a word from the wanderers. We were obliged to refrain for her sake, but we were all like as if news came from the dead -- ten long months and no word. After we were somewhat quieted sister Mary read the letter aloud. It was like reading the last will of the departed, we were all so unnerved. At the close of the letter we were informed to get in readiness and that the money was already on the way for us.

She is a genius at recognizing patterns and can easily spot the underlying logic in situations and the connections between things. Though she has received excellent performance reviews on all technical aspects of her work so far, she typically receives unsatisfactory ratings on her ability to relate to colleagues and clients. Now, this woman may be a terrific companion to a very small circle of understanding friends, but her blunt methods of communication and lack of ability to tactfully disagree create real obstacles in her private and work life. It’s common knowledge that she was recently denied advancement to a higher position.

Closely following his arrival in Vienna, Beethoven began studying composition with Haydn, applying himself with great diligence to the work in hand; but master and pupil did not get along together very well. There were many dissonances from the start. It was not in the nature of things that two beings so entirely dissimilar in their point of view should work together harmoniously. Beethoven, original, independent, iconoclastic, acknowledged no superior, without having as yet achieved anything to demonstrate his superiority; Haydn, tied down to established forms, subservient, meek, was only happy when sure of the approbation of his superiors. His attitude toward those above him in rank was characterized by respect and deference; he probably expected something similar from Beethoven toward himself.

During daily interactions, an elephant might vocalize to indicate hunger or thirst or to signal that the herd should head toward a different location. For example, a specific grunting noise is made by one member of the herd when a meal is over and the herd needs to get moving. Other specific calls announce when danger is nearby. When a predator threatens the calves, a distinctive loud sound, similar to the sound of a jackhammer, can be used to call other members of the herd. Hearing it, the rest of the herd forms a circle around the young ones to protect them. Elephants can produce and hear sounds much lower in frequency than the range of human hearing. These low-frequency sounds carry over great distances, up to two miles, helping males and females find each other during mating season and signaling lost elephants back to the herd.

According to the passage, what is one reason that elephants use a specific grunting noise?

Dust coats the skin of mammals and the feathers of birds, and it soaks up extra oil on the skin or feathers. The absorption of oil from the fur or feathers also helps them become more fluffy and insulating. Some mammals may dust bathe not only to keep clean, but for reasons related to social bonding and territory marking. Chinchillas within a colony, for example, bathe in the same dusty spots around their burrow to help mark their territory with a common scent. Some species of birds dust bathe to remove other minor irritants and help slough off dead skin flakes, which in turn decreases the potential food supply of certain parasites that eat the dead skin. Clearly, bathing without water has its place in the animal kingdom.

According to the passage, chinchillas in the same colony take dust baths around their burrows to

A.	absorb excess oil on their skin.

In other words, when offered more choices, customers are more likely to find the best match for their needs. However, too many choices may overwhelm customers and lead them to buy nothing at all. For example, a study showed that a display with 24 varieties of a certain brand of jam drew more people than a display with just 6 jam varieties of the same brand, but fewer people actually purchased the jam at the display with 24 choices. Of the people who saw 24 jam choices, only 3% purchased any variety of the jam. In contrast, 30% of the people who saw 6 jam choices bought some of the jam. Studies suggest that a balance between appealing to a variety of preferences and making a decision difficult, or between five and nine options, is about right for most people.

Orange carrots are thought to have been developed in the Netherlands in the 1500s from yellow varieties. Some say that loyal farmers in that country bred them to honor the ruling family, called the House of Orange. There is no evidence of the truth of this tale, but the timing and location of the development of orange carrots has led to this belief. Orange carrots do have an advantage over other carrots; they are rich in beta-carotene, a necessary nutrient for the human body. Interestingly, purple and white carrots contain no carotenes; however, purple carrots do contain anthocyanins, antioxidants that may help to protect people from certain types of cancer and other illnesses. The medicinal value of carrot plants may even have been known 4,000 years ago, based on discoveries of wild carrot seeds at sites of human habitation.

The ancient artifacts showed advanced metalworking techniques, which was unexpected given the location of the pits far from what was previously considered the center of sophisticated ancient China. Several masks were found with unusual fantastical features, such as atypical protruding eyes and wing-like ears. There were also many statues of men and of animals such as snakes and birds. Did the animal statues represent a belief in animal spirits? What was the function of the pits themselves?

Unfortunately, most work environments frown on napping, considering it wasted time and possibly an indicator of an unmotivated worker. This anti-napping bias is actually detrimental, because maximum productiveness is often not sustainable for an entire workday of eight or more hours. Taking a break to eat or walk around is acceptable, so why not a napping break? In fact, some work environments have already discovered the effectiveness of napping. A study at NASA found that sleepy pilots and astronauts improved work performance and alertness after a 40-minute nap. Even a short nap of only 10 to 30 minutes fits in well with most work schedules and offers many benefits without the initial grogginess that can result from a longer nap.

Some cultures value a rapid flow of ideas, even if that means interrupting someone who is speaking. Other cultures value unhurried conversation, giving the speaker the time to finish a thought and allowing pauses for participants to think quietly. Similarly, some cultures value differences of opinion because they indicate new perspectives and possibly an improved way of thinking about a situation, whereas other cultures value approaching differing opinions with significant care because they indicate conflict and disharmony. Communication styles may even vary within groups in the same area. Before entering a discussion with a new group of people, observe that group’s particular communication style before rushing in carelessly.

Animals talk to each other, of course. There can be no question about that; but I suppose there are very few people who can understand them. I never knew but one man who could. I knew he could, however, because he told me so himself. He was a middle-aged, simple-hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner of California, among the woods and mountains, a good many years, and had studied the ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the birds, until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made. This was Jim Baker. According to Jim Baker, some animals have only a limited education, and some use only simple words, and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure; whereas, certain other animals have a large vocabulary, a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery; consequently these latter talk a great deal; they like it; they are so conscious of their talent, and they enjoy “showing off.”

It was the creation of George Owen Squier, a U.S. Army major general who served as the Army’s chief signal officer during World War I. Squier was an inventor and had the idea of selling background music to companies as a way to increase worker productivity. The music he sold originally contained lyrics, but this was quickly changed when it was found that workers were clapping and singing along to the songs. To remedy this problem, Squier invested in research and created instrumental music that was carefully designed to be unobtrusive. Though it was difficult to prove that background music improved worker productivity, it seemed plausible to the companies who purchased Squier’s music that it would have a positive impact on their businesses.

There are several approaches to reduce unwanted sounds, or, simply put, noise. The most obvious is to move farther away from the sound source, because the intensity of sound decreases as the distance from the source increases. Alternatively, noise can be partially blocked, such as by closing a door to create a sound barrier between a loud television program and a person trying to read. A different technique, utilizing materials with surfaces that absorb vibrations, can be used to lessen noise within a space by dampening the sound waves. This approach is useful if rooms have reflective surfaces that create an echo. The echo can be reduced by covering a hardwood floor with a rug, for example, or by applying acoustic tiles to a ceiling.

In North America, these two spiders are the only ones that have dangerous bites. Female black widow spiders can be identified by a red hourglass shape on their shiny, black body. They are usually found in places with undisturbed, accumulated debris. The brown recluse spider is sometimes called a violin or fiddle-back spider due to the violin-shaped marking on its head. Interestingly, this spider only has six eyes as opposed to the usual eight. Both of these arachnids are usually located in dry, secluded areas, and, like most spiders, are ordinarily shy and will only bite in self-defense. When a black widow spider does bite, it makes two puncture marks in the skin and injects toxic venom that can spread throughout the body. The brown recluse spider’s bite can cause a stinging sensation and destroy skin tissue. Happily, thanks to their timidity, these creatures are fairly easy to avoid.

A truffle spore will come into contact with one of the tree’s tiny rootlets and begin to wrap around it with long, threadlike structures called filaments. The tree’s carbohydrates provide the energy for more filaments to be formed, and these continue to expand into a web-like form. When the mass of filaments is dense enough, a single, potato-looking young truffle fruit is produced. It grows rapidly and then ripens, becoming strongly aromatic. This aroma is how mature truffles are found. Both hogs and dogs are used to sniff out the expensive treats, but many hunters prefer to use dogs because they are less likely to consume the fungi once found. When these animals dig up the truffles, spores are distributed and the growth process begins again.

Using its nasal passage to make clicks, a dolphin can focus sound into a beam through tissue in its very large forehead and broadcast the sound through water. The sound then bounces off any object it encounters, returning as an echo. The dolphin’s jaw absorbs the reflected sound waves, and the sound is then transmitted to its inner ear. From there, nerve impulses are sent to the brain for processing and interpretation. To gather additional information about an object of interest, dolphins can quickly vary the frequency of their sonar signals and transmit them from different angles and locations as they swim. The sonar system dolphins use is so sophisticated that it can judge the contours of an object, as well as how large or small the object is.

However, besides the sense of accomplishment one feels from being able to communicate with others in a new language, there may be additional cognitive benefits. Research suggests that multilingual adults who experience a severe decline in their intellectual ability, as in dementia, do so at a later age than those who are monolingual. Additionally, those who know more than one language usually have improved multitasking skills -- likely developed from practicing switching from language to language -- and are good at remembering lists or sequences.

When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it. My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid [scolded] for my singularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would board myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I could save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for buying books.

On each side of them, beyond the dusty highway, stretched out broad fields of tender young corn. On the yon side of the fields uprose the sturdy oaks and beeches and ashes of the forest; while at their feet modest violets peeped out shyly and greeted the loiterers with an odor which made the heart glad. Over on the far side of the brook in a tiny bay floated three lily-pads; and from amid some clover blossoms on the bank an industrious bee rose with the hum of busy contentment. It was a day so brimful of quiet joy that the two friends lay flat on their backs gazing up at the scurrying clouds, and neither caring to break the silence.

Which of the following literary techniques does the author use to describe the violets?

“I wish that instead of being here I might be well out of my scrape, and in a safe place.” That was what the soldier said; and hardly had the words left his lips when -- whisk! whir! -- away flew the stool through the window, so suddenly that the soldier had only just time enough to gripe it tight by the legs to save himself from falling. Whir! whiz! -- away it flew like a bullet. Up and up it went -- so high in the air that the earth below looked like a black blanket spread out in the night; and then down it came again, with the soldier still griping tight to the legs, until at last it settled as light as a feather upon a balcony of the king's palace; and when the soldier caught his wind again he found himself without a hat, and with hardly any wits in his head.

Bonds are a promise from a government, company, or other organization to pay back an investor the money paid for the bonds -- their face value -- along with some percentage of interest. The U.S. government offers bonds, called Treasury bonds, to fund certain programs. All bonds pay the investor interest at a specific rate and schedule, and they also have a specific term associated with them, meaning how much time until the face value of the bond is paid back. For instance, some Treasury bonds pay interest every six months and have a specific term of 30 years. Because an investor knows exactly what the term is, with some forethought, it is possible to be repaid at just the right time to reinvest the money in something else, such as a new business or college tuition. In general, bonds are considered a low-risk investment, because the expectation is that the issuer will be able to pay them back.

According to the passage, what does it mean for a bond to have a specific term associated with it?

A.	It is considered a low-risk investment.
B.	The money is used to fund certain programs.
C.	It is known exactly when the face value will be repaid.

1881.	Table tennis began as a parlor game in England in the 1880s. Lawn tennis was popular, so an indoor version was created for when the weather was poor. Guests at parties would line up objects in the center of a table to create a dividing line, and a round cork would be used as the ball. The paddle could have been almost anything the party guests had on hand. As the game became more popular, it was significantly formalized. Rules were established and game-specific balls, paddles, and tables began to be produced. The game was introduced to Japan, Austria, and Hungary in the first decade of the 1900s, and it continued to spread until it was known worldwide. During the ensuing decades, the game and its equipment evolved. For example, the addition of rubber matting to the paddles allowed players to impart incredible spin on the ball, and the game advanced to a fast-moving game of skill. Over time, table tennis grew so popular that it became an Olympic event in 1988.

1882.	Snoring is the sound that happens when breathing is partially blocked in the throat and nose during sleep. The narrowed passageway causes the tissue in the mouth and nose to vibrate -- it is similar to how people can whistle by almost closing their lips and then blowing. Because snoring may indicate breathing difficulties, reducing your risk of snoring, if possible, is a good idea. One way to do this is to sleep on your side rather than on your back. When sleeping on your back, your throat is pulled on by gravity and your airway is thus narrowed more than when sleeping on your side. Another way to help reduce snoring is to lose excess weight, because weight on the neck reduces airflow in the throat. A third approach is to improve muscle tone in the throat, either by exercising, which can improve muscle tone throughout your body, or by doing specific throat exercises such as singing. With improved muscle tone in the throat comes a reduction in vibrating tissue, and less snoring.

According to the passage, how can losing weight help a person snore less?

A.	It strengthens and tightens the muscles in the person’s throat.
B.	It encourages the person to sleep in a more effective position.
C.	It accelerates the motion of tissues within the person’s nasal passageway.
D.	It increases the amount of space for air to move through the person’s throat.

1883.	Psychologists in the early 20th century discovered that the result of a behavior determines the frequency of that behavior. As an experimental example shows, if a rat is placed in a cage with a lever that releases food when it is pressed, the rat learns to press the lever whenever it wants food. Pressing a lever is not an instinctive behavior for a rat, but receiving food is a sufficiently strong result to teach the rat to do so. This cause-and-effect relationship is called “operant conditioning.” Psychologists determined that there were several ways to influence behavior using conditioning, including rewarding wanted behaviors, punishing unwanted behaviors, and taking away rewards to stop unwanted behaviors. For example, a parent who allows a child privileges for behaving well, and takes away privileges when the child misbehaves, is applying principles of conditioning. Much of what psychologists discovered with conditioning has been applied to behavior in a variety of settings, such as classrooms, prisons, and psychological therapy programs.

According to the passage, which of the following statements about operant conditioning is correct?

A.	It was discovered to be an instinctive behavior in rats.

I prevent insects from becoming a problem in my kitchen, for example, by sealing up food containers and not leaving fruit and other foods out on the counters. In our garage, I use recycling bins and garbage cans with tight lids, and I make sure the bins are picked up weekly. Once, when I noticed that ants had discovered a way into my teenager’s bedroom, I found that cleaning their trails with soap and water worked to eliminate the traces that other ants follow, and this kept them from returning. Around the perimeter of the ground floor of my house, I sealed cracks I noticed in the window frames and doorways. I learned some plants -- if they are placed near home entrances -- can repel pests, so I may decide one day to plant some of these by my front door.

It might be easy to account for their intimate acquaintance with the hours of meals, since their stomach is practically their clock. But that a dog should know to a ""tic"" the time for his master's departure from the house -- whatever the season of the year, tugging him by his coat -- should he not be ready, or fetching his stick -- allows of no other explanation than that of a canine sense of time.

The toddlers I cared for entertained me with their silliness and challenged me with their energetic play. They also tested my patience with their endless requests for “more” or “again” -- one more reading of the same little story, one more glass of water, one more push on the swing. Among many of my youthful peers, and hosts of big brothers and sisters, the presumption was that our little eighteen-month-old charges delighted in finding ways to annoy us by tricking us into satisfying their wishes. Sometimes we found it easier just to pretend we didn’t notice them at all. Now that I’m a parent, I discovered from reading child development theory that children under two years of age have typically not yet reached the stage where they have willpower, or the ability to assert their autonomy. Consider me enlightened.

The thin shadows of early dusk were falling, casting a pallid tint over the world, a tint touched here and there with living fire from the sun, which was gone, though leaving burning embers behind. One glowing shaft, piercing straight through the heavy forest that clothed either bank, fell directly upon the figure in the boat, as a hidden light illuminates a great picture, while the rest is left in shadow. It was no common forest runner who sat in the middle of the red beam. Yet a boy, in nothing but years, he swung the great paddle with an ease and vigor that the strongest man in the West might have envied. His rifle, with the stock carved beautifully, and the long, slender blue barrel of the border, lay by his side. He could bring the paddle into the boat, grasp the rifle, and carry it to his shoulder with a single, continuous movement.

Our daughter wanted to see Lava Beds National Monument, so California was our first stop in June to explore caves made by flowing lava hundreds of thousands of years ago. We then enjoyed camping at Hovenweep in Utah, after studying the centuries-old stone homes that grip the rim of the canyon and were built by Ancestral Puebloans. June ended with an excursion to Fossil Butte, Wyoming, where our son satisfied his curiosity about fossils at the visitor center. We had to fly home for a wedding in California at the beginning of July, so while there we visited nearby Saguaro and hiked among the many giant cacti. Near the end of July, we headed north to Oregon Caves for one more adventure, spelunking in marble caves. It was a wonderful journey.

The first step is to harvest the annatto seeds and crush them to create the coloring agent. The next step is to filter out any extraneous material for even, consistent coloration. Then the coloring agent is packed into a fine powder or paste and extracted. Extraction involves separating out the color from the raw material via boiling or chemical processing. After extraction, the dye is ready, and it’s time to prepare the other key ingredient for natural dyeing: the mordant. A mordant is a substance that helps color from the dye bond with the fibers of the fabric. Mordants are usually chemicals like metallic salts, such as ferrous sulfate, dissolved in water. Boil your fabric in a mordant bath, and then it can be soaked in your natural dye. Your new peach fabric can be used after it is washed, rinsed, and dried.

Based on the passage, what should be done immediately before preparing the mordant?

A.	Filter the coloring agent.

After ripe olives are gathered, they are washed to remove stems and debris, and then loaded into a stone mill -- a large stone wheel that rolls in a circle against a stone table. The mill crushes the olives into a paste. The paste is then mixed or kneaded until oil droplets form on the surface. At this stage, the paste is ready to be separated into oil, solids, and water using an olive press. First, each disk of the press is covered with a layer of paste. Then the disks are stacked and pressure is applied until the oil and water run together down the sides of the stack, leaving the solids behind. After settling separates the liquids, the olive oil is skimmed off the top of the water. A final filtering may be necessary before the olive oil is bottled.

You can break up the crystals as they form, by keeping the ice cream mixture constantly moving as it freezes. This can be accomplished by placing a bowl of ice cream mixture into a larger container of ice, salt, and water and stirring the mixture often. It can also be done by putting the ice cream mixture into a leak-proof bag, surrounding it with another leak-proof bag filled with ice and salt, and mashing the bags around frequently. Another approach requires even less work, while still avoiding the cost of buying ice cream-making equipment: simply add extra sugar. This changes the chemistry of the mixture itself, making it difficult for large ice crystals to form at all. This type of mixture can be put into the freezer to achieve an easy and fun ice cream treat.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	Freezing an ice cream mixture at rest can result in large ice crystals.

In the sunlight -- in the daytime, when Nature is alive and busy all around us, we like the open hill-sides and the deep woods well enough: but in the night, when our Mother Earth has gone to sleep, and left us waking, oh! the world seems so lonesome, and we get frightened, like children in a silent house. Then we sit and sob, and long for the gas-lit streets, and the sound of human voices, and the answering throb of human life. We feel so helpless and so little in the great stillness, when the dark trees rustle in the night-wind. There are so many ghosts about, and their silent sighs make us feel so sad.

Depending on the language, change can happen gradually or quickly as new generations and populations start creating and using new words. New words are created to refer to things that never existed before, often in response to changes in technology, such as the word “Internet.” Most of the time new words are not entirely original, but are drawn from existing words and used in a new way. Subcultures of a population, such as teens, often invent new words to obscure meaning to outsiders or to demonstrate membership in a group. For example, the slang word “flapper” was invented in the 1920s to refer to young, liberated women who cut their hair and listened to jazz music. Evolution even happens to slang words themselves. In the fourteenth century, the word “awful” was slang for “awe-inspiring,” but slowly evolved to its standard meaning of “very bad.” New words must spread to the wider population and sometimes even to the next generation to gain full acceptance into the language.

This cuts down on incidental noise to improve listening, and also increases the chances that a motion-oriented attacker, such as a lion, might fail to notice them. While a person is wondering what to do, several involuntary changes immediately happen in the body. The pupils of the eyes dilate to improve vision. Non-essential functions of the body temporarily cease, such as digestion and saliva production. The body’s energy is instead channeled into essential processes, such as filling the lungs with oxygen to prepare for physical exertion. The sweat glands expand to facilitate cooling of the body when exerting significant energy, and the blood vessels near the skin restrict, helping to reduce blood loss in the case of injury. In addition, increased activity occurs in parts of the brain responsible for action rather than deep thinking, and the brain releases a surge in pain-dampening chemicals.

The main point of the passage is that when humans are in danger,

A.	uncontrollable physical changes take place in their bodies.

It is believed that the dachshund was developed about 300 years ago by breeders in Germany for use as a hunting dog. Dachshunds were used to help people hunt badgers, foxes, and other burrowing animals. If the prey was a fox, the dachshund would chase the creature out of its hole, making it visible to the hunter. Alternatively, the dachshund would follow a badger deep into a burrow until the badger was cornered, and would then fight it below ground. Although dachshunds are about the same size as foxes and badgers, these fearless dogs succeeded in the chase by working cooperatively with their canine and human teams.

Unlike anteaters, pangolins are protected from predators by overlapping armor-like scales that shield all but the underside of their body. When threatened, pangolins quickly roll into a tight ball. The scales -- which are made of the same protein that is in human hair and fingernails -- grow nonstop and are continuously worn down by the act of burrowing. Pangolins burrow into anthills and termite nests using their relatively long claws to find their prey, which they then lick with their tongues. The incredible tongues are not only sticky but are longer than the animal’s entire body when fully extended. Another unique feature of this mammal is that its stomach acts like the gizzard in a bird. Small stones and spiny quill-like protrusions in the pangolin’s stomach help mash up food as part of the digestion process.

Dutch and English sailors introduced ketchup to Europe in the 1600s when they brought it back to flavor their food. Sailors and other travelers prized the thin, dark sauce (at the time lacking tomato-based ingredients) because it kept well during long explorations. The British tried to replicate the sauce by combining anchovies, vinegar, ginger, cloves, and other ingredients. They even concocted a mushroom version and another that featured oysters. In fact, just about any type of spiced sauce used as a condiment was called “ketchup.” Naturally, British colonists brought the sauce with them to North America, but it wasn’t until 1812 that Philadelphian James Mease published his recipe for what is regarded as the first tomato-based ketchup. A few decades later, ketchup was commercially produced with the flavors that many are familiar with today.

There are many cases in which practice in singing does not bring about technical perfection. The mere singing of technical exercises is not enough; it is of vital importance that the exercises be sung in some particular manner. There is one certain way in which the voice must be handled during the practice of singing. If the vocal organs are exercised in this particular manner, the voice will improve steadily as the result of practice. This progress will continue until perfect technical command of the voice is acquired. But if the vocal student fails to hit upon this particular way of handling the voice in practice the voice will improve little, or not at all. In such a case perfect vocal technique will never be acquired, no matter how many years the practice may continue.

Based on the passage, the author’s main point is that

A.	vocal perfection requires a particular method of practice.
B.	perfect vocal technique depends on exercising certain muscles.
C.	vocal perfection is acquired by setting a series of obtainable goals.
D.	perfect vocal technique is predominantly a matter of diligent practice.

An extraordinary change took place upon the surface of Florence Atwater: all superciliousness and derision of the world vanished; her eyes opened wide, and into them came a look at once far-away and intently fixed. Also, a frown of concentration appeared upon her brow, and her lips moved silently, but with rapidity, as if she repeated to herself something of almost tragic import. Florence had recently read a newspaper account of the earlier struggles of a now successful actress: As a girl, this determined genius went about the streets repeating the lines of various roles to herself -- constantly rehearsing, in fact, upon the public thoroughfares, so carried away was she by her intended profession and so set upon becoming famous.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	Florence admits to herself that her obsession with fame may have gone too far.
B.	Florence is stunned when she reads about the childhood of her favorite actress.
C.	Florence is mimicking the training techniques once used by a successful actress.

Stairways or tiered steps lining the steep walls allow people to access the water stored within. Chand Baori, one of the oldest stepwells, was built over 1,000 years ago in Rajasthan, India. This architectural wonder boasts an amazing 3,500 steps leading down into a pool of water. Three sides of the stepwell comprise a geometrical arrangement of steps in a zigzag pattern while another side features intricately designed pavilions housing sculptures, a stage, and even rooms for the royal family. Historically, Chand Baori’s chief purpose was to collect and store water for people to use for washing, irrigating crops, and drinking. However, it also served as a community gathering place, offering locals and visitors refuge from high temperatures during warmer seasons. Though this stepwell is no longer used as a water source, the site is preserved as a tourist attraction.

At a young age, he became an avid inventor and learned many skills under his father, who was Belgium’s chief instrument maker. Sax’s project began as an experiment that combined brass, woodwind, and stringed instrument qualities. Sax initially called his invention the bass horn, but the name “saxophone” gained popularity after a French newspaper introduced it as “le saxophon.” Sax was hopeful that his new instrument would become a staple in the orchestra, but due mainly to the instrument’s lack of precise intonation at the time, this did not come to pass. However, the saxophone was revered by the French military, whose use of it gave its band a strong, powerful sound. Soon, military bands around the world followed suit, which was how the saxophone came to New Orleans where it quickly became indispensable as a jazz instrument.

According to the passage, how did the saxophone gain worldwide attention?

Since its construction, the abbey has had multiple uses. For example, during the Hundred Years’ War in the 14th century, it was converted into a fortress to defend against English troops. In fact, it was the only location in Normandy that was not conquered. Later in the 18th century, the abbey was turned into a prison during the French Revolution. However, the abbey is known not only for its varied uses or its ancient beginnings, but also for its stunning natural setting. Each day the incoming tides, the highest in Europe, surround the island with powerful currents that give it the appearance of a lone, castle-like edifice floating on water. Today, visitors travel from all over the world to view this natural phenomenon.

Stepping onto the music scene at the turn of the twentieth century, Ma Rainey’s vaudeville performances, incredible stage persona, and uniquely raspy vocals brought together in a new way two distinct styles of the blues: country blues, characterized by rough vocals, and urban blues, which had a more polished, classic sound. This unique vocal and performing style had a tremendous impact on another blues legend, Bessie Smith. Often referred to as the “Empress of the Blues,” Smith joined Rainey’s Tennessee-based musical troupe at just eighteen years old. She later became a success in both classical blues and jazz circles. Smith, like Rainey, influenced numerous other female performers in the decades that followed.

By developing and practicing proper breath-holding techniques, free divers can dive deep enough to observe marine life. Nevertheless, people have long sought ways of extending both diving time and depth. Before rigid-helmet diving suits were invented in the 1800s, diving chambers were used to greatly increase the time divers could remain underwater. These chambers were filled with air from the surface, but they limited interaction with undersea objects. Rigid-helmet diving suits were an improvement on diving chambers because they allowed pressurized air to be pumped into the diver’s helmet through long tubes, thus providing an effectively unlimited air supply and increasing freedom of movement. Later inventors struck upon the idea of equipping the diver with a portable compressed-air tank, vastly increasing maneuverability and diving depth.

According to the passage, how did divers first dramatically increase the amount of time they could remain underwater?

A.	They used portable compressed-air tanks.

Their numerous glands secrete a liquid that contains small fibers, which help make the slime extremely sticky. This slime creates a protective covering and is difficult for predators to remove. As soon as the predator takes a hagfish into its mouth, the slime coats the predator’s gills and it begins to suffocate, forcing the predator to spit out its intended meal. In some cases, even if the predator can’t or won’t spit out the hagfish, the hagfish will slip out of its slime sheath by tying itself into a knot and then working the knot down its body to remove the sheath, thus freeing itself from the predator’s grasp. Fortunately for the hagfish, it has a sneeze-like reflex that allows it to free its own nostrils of slime. A less unusual form of avoidance from predators is also used by the hagfish--burying itself in loose sand at the bottom of the ocean.

According to the passage, the hagfish can free itself from a predator’s grasp by

A.	secreting tiny fibers.

There are various reasons why people might read slowly, including issues related to vision. In these cases, it’s best to work with an eye doctor to solve the problem. Other reasons for slower reading speed are related to habits, which can be improved through practice and concentration. For example, some people mouth the words they read or “hear” the sounds of the words in their minds. This is a technique beginning readers use when they are taught to sound out the words. But advanced readers minimize this process and focus on word meaning, thus reading more quickly. Another habit that can make people read slower is unintentional re-reading of sentences and paragraphs, particularly because peoples’ minds tend to wander when doing so. Maintaining focus on the subject and being willing to press on without comprehending every word of every sentence can greatly increase reading speed. Forming these habits requires practice, but can lead to improved reading efficiency.

According to the passage, why do some readers mouth the words they read?

A.	It is a habit they developed to compensate for vision issues.
B.	It is a technique they use to increase reading efficiency.

First of all, practice is crucial for success. Whether the trouble is fear of being embarrassed in public or a simple lack of skill in speaking clearly, more practice will improve the situation. Even practicing alone in front of a mirror can be helpful, but it’s better to practice in low-risk public environments, like in front of a group of people you know well. The other crucial starting point to improving public speaking is identifying your current habits. Note how often you pause or use filler words like “um.” Pay attention to how often you make nervous gestures, such as shifting your weight from foot to foot or looking down. You can recruit a friend to make notes for you to help track such behaviors, or you can record a video of yourself and study it. Once you know what your current habits are, you can focus on improving them.

The base is the substance that is used to carry and dilute the scenting agent, which can sometimes be too strong for direct contact with skin. Common bases are alcohol, neutral oils (such as jojoba oil) or a mixture of both. The scenting agent is the ingredient that gives the perfume its aroma. Scenting agents, called essential oils, are readily available at health-food stores or can even be made at home. Lemon oil, for example, can be made by pressing lemon peels. Only a few drops of essential oil are necessary to include in the base. Mixing fruit and floral essential oils together helps create interesting aromatic combinations. The evaporation rates of the essential oils can affect the scent of the perfume over time. Some essential oils evaporate quickly and release their aroma immediately, whereas others may take minutes or hours to be noticed. Developing a unique natural perfume can be rewarding and exciting.

One simple test involves showing a subject two dishes behind a window, one with food and the other without. While the subject watches, the dishes are moved in opposite directions to locations hidden behind a screen. If the subject moves toward the dish with food, this demonstrates that the animal understands “object permanence” -- knowing that an object still exists even after it is not visible. Crows, perform well on this test, as do dogs. Rabbits and chickens do poorly. Another test involves showing a subject images of objects that are either the same or different, using a computer and two buttons for the response. The subject is rewarded with food for touching the correct button. By changing the images, researchers can test the ability of animals to understand “sameness” regardless of the object in question.

With a background in stage magic, he transferred some of these skills to his films and in the process invented special effects for movies. For example, he showed a lady “disappearing” by splicing together film sequences. Melies was also the first to create a movie set, which for him was simply a glass house with one solid wall where he staged his set pieces. Using his new techniques -- including stop-motion photography and transitions called wipes -- he was able to weave together full stories into a movie format. Furthermore, he made the first color movie by having each frame of a black and white film laboriously hand-colored. Although known worldwide for his science fiction films, especially “A Trip to the Moon,” Melies made over 500 films covering a wide variety of genres -- including history, horror, and fairy tales--over the course of his career.

Until the invention of the hollow surfboard in the 1920s, boards were heavy and not very buoyant, making them challenging to maneuver. The old style boards were made of a solid piece of material, usually a hefty wood like redwood, and were known to extend ten feet or longer, reaching over one hundred pounds. In 1926, surfer and mid-western native Tom Blake aimed to improve on ancient surfboard designs by drilling holes into the heavy wood and covering it with marine plywood. After a few more design improvements, which included using a wooden framework instead of solid wood, Tom Blake introduced surfers to the hollow-core surfboard. This innovative design made the boards much easier to handle, and they dominated the surfing market until the 1940s, when modern surfboard companies began incorporating foam into their designs to yield even shorter, lighter boards.

Fortunately, there are simple things you can do to reduce your stress level, including practicing yoga. In addition to being a good strength-building exercise, yoga can help manage stress because it promotes deep breathing and relaxation of both the body and the mind. In fact, yoga is a Sanskrit word that means “to yoke or bind” or “to unite,” which is appropriate because yoga aims to create harmony between the body, mind, and breath. For the body, yoga can help loosen tense muscles in the neck, shoulders, and back that tighten up when you are stressed. In addition, focusing your mind on your breathing and on how your body feels during yoga poses can help you forget about stress for a little while. Simply taking a few deep breaths can help you stay calm when you are in the middle of a stressful situation. So, if you struggle with stress, try practicing yoga to help increase your sense of calm, focus, and relaxation.

The answer depends on the type of food, according to information from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Washing raw poultry, beef, or pork before cooking it is not recommended because it is not an effective way to remove bacteria. In fact, bacteria from raw meat and poultry can be spread to other foods, utensils, and surfaces during the washing process, a possible food-safety issue known as cross-contamination. Cooking raw meat and poultry to the proper temperature is what makes it safe to eat. On the other hand, fresh fruits and vegetables should be washed with cold running water before being eaten raw or prepared, to remove dirt and reduce bacteria. Consumers can even use a brush to scrub fruits and vegetables that have hard surfaces, such as apples and potatoes. People preparing food should also remove any bruised or damaged areas on produce, because harmful bacteria can thrive in those places. Following these basic guidelines can help make all types of foods safer to eat.

In fact, the exact origin of the term “hot dog” is a mystery, even though the food probably only dates back a few hundred years. One long-standing myth contends that in the early 1900s, New York newspaper cartoonist Tad Dorgan saw frankfurter sandwiches for sale at a baseball game and the food inspired him to draw a cartoon of a dachshund on a roll. But, because he did not know how to spell the dog breed’s name, he labeled it “hot dog.” However, both the sausage sandwich and the term “hot dog” date back to at least 1890s. Another story preferred by some historians stars a frankfurter vendor from New Jersey named Thomas Francis Xavier Morris. In 1892, Morris, known as “Hot Dog Morris,” used his nickname to market the product. While it is hard to say exactly where the hot dog got its name, it’s undisputed that hot dog sales are still going strong today.

Other studies show that many first-year students arrive at college with inadequate study skills. While it’s true that developing good study habits takes practice, a few simple strategies can make studying more effective right away. For instance, setting aside a specific place to study that is reasonably quiet and has as few distractions as possible can help put students in the right state of mind. Also, setting and recording defined goals can improve a student’s ability to concentrate. For example, before beginning a reading assignment, preview it and decide how long it should take to read each chapter, then set a time-based goal to help reduce the temptation to daydream. Deciding on a certain time of day to study can also help make studying a regular habit rather than an all-night activity right before a big test.

Construction of the tower began in 1173, but was halted soon after it was discovered that the first stories were beginning to sink and lean to one side. It turned out that the tower was being built on a site with unstable soils that could not properly support the structure. A war then interfered with further construction for nearly a hundred years. In 1272, work resumed under the direction of engineer Giovanni de Simone, who added some stories that were taller on one side to try to correct the lean. Unfortunately, this produced the opposite effect; the tower sank even more and now had a slight curve to it as well. Due to battles and political unrest, the venture endured more interruptions before the top floor was completed in 1370. Then it took a few more centuries for engineers to successfully stabilize the structure, which has remained open to the public since 2001.

I have sometimes thought that only the elevated and elegant language of poetry should be employed in describing music: for music is poetry, and poetry is music; that is, in many of their characteristics they are one and the same. But, to put this idea in another form, let us say that Music is the beautiful sister of Poetry, that other soul-expressing medium; and who would create the latter must commune with the former, and be able to bring to his uses the sweet and finishing graces of her rhythmic forms. In early times, the qualities of the poet and musician were generally actually united in the same person. The poet usually set to music, and in most instances sang, his effusions.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	Poets are usually musicians.
B.	Poetry and music are closely associated.
C.	Musicians should use poets to write their lyrics.
D.	Music and poetry are ideal forms of expression.

Our musical judgments, which are our opinions, are governed by our experience; and with the growth of experience they ripen into solid convictions. For many years I have had a conviction that voice training is much simpler and less involved than it is generally considered. I am convinced that far too much is made of the vocal mechanism, which under normal conditions always responds automatically. Beautiful tone should be the primary aim of all voice teaching, and more care should be given to forming the student’s tone concept than to that of teaching him how to control his throat by direct effort. The controlling power of a right idea is still much underestimated. The scientific plan of controlling the voice by means of mechanical directions leaves untouched the one thing which prevents its normal, automatic action, namely tension.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	describe methods for teaching singers.
B.	argue for teaching proper tone above all else.
C.	warn against singers controlling their throats.
D.	point out the harmful effects of voice lessons.

It has been enjoyed as both a medicinal drink and a daily beverage for centuries, originating in China thousands of years ago. In the seventh century, seeds were brought from China to Japan, and cultivation was established throughout the island nation during the thirteenth century. Seeds were later brought to Taiwan, and eventually spread across other major Asian countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and other South Asian nations. In the sixteenth century, tea began to be imported to Europe, but was enjoyed primarily by the wealthy in the Netherlands, who could afford the costly beverage. The British had their first taste of tea around 1652, and by the late seventeenth century, thanks to Dutch traders, tea had become affordable and was being consumed by the general population in Europe. Tea remains one of the most popular beverages in the world today.

Braque is known as one of the fathers of Cubism, a visual art movement that began in the early 20th century. Cubism acquired its name from French art critic Louis Vauxcelles, who remarked on the cubic shapes in paintings by Braque. Instead of a realistic portrayal of objects, Cubism’s abstract geometric shapes were symbolic in nature. Masaccio, in contrast, adopted a style of linear perspective developed by Italian architect Brunelleschi in the 15th century. Masaccio used a grid framework to ensure subjects represented in his paintings would appear as real-life, three-dimensional objects. Masaccio adhered to a rigid set of conventions to produce his work, whereas Braque was part of a new era of creative freedom in the art world.

According to the passage, who coined the term for the art movement featuring symbolic geometric shapes?

His first magic acts were performed in modest settings with a friend, then a sibling, and eventually his wife. A few of his early tricks involved performing magic with cards or having his wife, Bess, pretend to read minds. On tour with a circus, Houdini would even perform comedy acts when his magic tricks were not well-received. The escape acts he would later become famous for first took place during 1895, four years after he began his career as a magician. Houdini’s big break finally came when he was invited to perform at vaudeville shows, which not only paid well but also propelled him into national, if not worldwide, fame. For the rest of his career, Houdini continued to invent new ways to awe his audiences, escaping from handcuffs, straitjackets, and even chains while underwater.

During his college years, Wilde placed first in his classics examinations, received scholarships, and won awards for his poetry. As a writer, he received much criticism for the content of his book and plays. Some material was said to be improper, offending Victorian morals. Wilde also received much attention for his attire and sense of aesthetics. He had long hair and wore clothes that were considered to be flamboyant during that time period. Though he was ridiculed and satirized for his dress, Wilde did not seem to mind the negative attention he was receiving.

This was a considerable feat at the time because prior to Tudor, ice was only sold regionally. When Tudor first seriously pursued his idea of collecting blocks of ice from North America and shipping them to the tropics, his efforts were initially ridiculed. People did not believe it was possible to preserve ice during a long sea voyage. In fact, Tudor even had to purchase his own ship because no merchant supported his idea. In 1806, his ship was loaded with 80 tons of ice and sailed from Boston to the island of Martinique. Although the cargo arrived intact, the endeavor failed because islanders weren’t interested in buying the ice; they didn’t think they needed it. To create demand, Tudor came up with innovative marketing strategies, such as giving ice away free. The hard work paid off and Tudor’s business started to gain momentum. With increased demand for his product and new ice-harvesting methods, Tudor eventually became a millionaire.

According to the passage, Tudor’s business first started to become successful when he

A.	used inventive sales techniques to convince people to buy ice.

Using the definition accepted by the U.S. Customs Office, an item over a hundred years old is an antique, and that condition alone may make your old chair valuable. An antique item that is also in good condition, a rare piece, or was particularly well-made can be worth quite a lot. To find out if an item is an antique, talk to people who know the item’s history, or check carefully for a date somewhere on the item. If there is no straightforward indication of age, you can determine an estimated age by looking for the hallmarks of an earlier period of craftsmanship. Handmade screws in an old piece of furniture, for example, would have unevenly spaced spirals and other irregularities that clearly distinguish them from those in a modern piece. Items you determine to be antique should be brought to an appraiser to learn their market value.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

A.	Very old items are valuable because they were made with superior craftsmanship.
B.	Antique items must be given a value by an appraiser before they can be sold.
C.	It is possible to assess whether an item is an antique without being an expert.
D.	It is best to keep a detailed history of furniture owned for later sale.

The most basic form of pilot’s certificate in the U.S. is called the student pilot certificate. To qualify, one must be at least sixteen years old (or fourteen to fly gliders or balloons), have English-language proficiency, and possess a medical certificate issued by an aviation examiner. The certificate endorsed for solo flight allows a pilot to fly alone. To get the endorsement, a student pilot takes flying lessons at an airport with a certified flight instructor. The student must pass a written test about flying, and then the instructor must sign off that the student knows how to take off and land safely, as well as how to react to various unexpected situations. Once a pilot has this most basic certification, it takes considerably more time, effort, and endorsements to earn a private pilot certificate in order to make long-distance air trips and carry passengers. At that point, the possibilities are almost endless.

According to the passage, what does an endorsed student pilot certificate allow a pilot to do?

Many visitors to these massive trees are humbled by their size -- 20 feet in diameter at the base of a standard tree, 34 feet in diameter for the largest trees. Equally impressive to some visitors is the age of these ancient organisms. Burned sections and sizeable cracks in sequoia trunks may indicate that they survived splintering lightning strikes or raging fires that took place centuries ago. Holes of all shapes and sizes show how they have endured being used as a source of food and shelter by countless generations of animals. Some trees even show clear evidence of having been cut partway through; nevertheless, they live on. Much has changed in human society in 2,000 years, and yet some of these majestic trees have lived through all of it, standing tall.

These bats weigh approximately two grams -- about the weight of a dime -- and are the size of a large bumblebee, as their name suggests. Like other bats, they hunt using echolocation, meaning that they listen to the echoes of their own squeaks to locate prey and obstacles. Some carnivorous bats consume lizards and frogs, but for bumblebee bats, the prey must be quite small, such as flies and mosquitoes. When hunting, bumblebee bats can hover in the air like hummingbirds. They live in Thailand and Myanmar in Southeast Asia, where they form colonies of about a dozen to a few hundred bats. Characteristic of many species of bats, they nest in caves and come out at night to hunt.

The group may split the bill evenly, or each person might pay for his or her own portion. The method may depend on the occasion, but it is also heavily dependent on local culture. In South Korea, for example, traditionally the oldest person pays for everything. In Mexico and Colombia, it is typically the person who invited the others who pays for the meal. In some places, such as Lebanon and Ireland, people compete and even use trickery to earn the honor of paying. In many places, including Australia, it is assumed that everyone will chip in a roughly equal amount to pay the tab. Another cultural variation is whether it is considered more polite to accept an offer or to refuse an offer of another person paying. In Spain, it can be insulting to argue with someone who agrees to pay. In China, it is rude to remain silent when someone offers to pay -- some token protest is considered polite.

According to the passage, when presented with a restaurant bill in Australia, it is customary

A.	to compete with others for the right to pay.

Add about six quarts of cold water to the pot for a one-pound box of pasta. Pasta cooked in too little water can clump and cook unevenly. Cover the pot with a lid and place over high heat until the water comes to a boil, and then add one to two tablespoons of salt. That may sound like a lot, but most pasta is made with little or no salt in the dough. The amount of salt can be adjusted if necessary due to dietary restrictions or preference, but if no salt is added, the pasta will be bland. Some think that adding a little oil to the water is necessary to prevent sticking, but I recommend simply stirring and this won’t be an issue. Just add the pasta to the boiling water, stir, and return to a boil. Drain the pasta when it is still slightly chewy, and transfer it to a warm serving bowl.

According to the passage, what should a person do just after adding salt to the water?

A.	cover the pot with a lid

If the game is an adaptation from an existing story, like a movie, then it is only necessary to choose the scope of the game. Otherwise, the story must be created in a rough form. Determining the story establishes the characters and other elements, such as obstacles and vehicles that will be present in the game. Characters are designed, and game makers are subsequently able to program the character movements. The look of the environment and level design comprise the next major steps. Once the characters and all other game elements are designed, the game must be coded. Even with the use of coding programs that provide shortcuts to create three-dimensional images, the process is time-consuming and complex. The final stages in most productions include the writing and recording of dialogue and the creation of music and other required audio effects.

Based on the passage, what happens immediately before the look of the environment of a video game is designed?

A.	The story is outlined in rough form.
B.	The scope of the game is determined.
C.	The character movements are planned.
D.	The level design of the game is finalized.

When building a yurt, the first step is to create a circular lattice wall. A series of wooden laths or sticks are set in a crisscrossing diagonal pattern and fastened together, forming a complete circle, except for a space left for the door. Then the crown, or circular roof with a hole in the middle, is made. It is similar to a wheel, with wooden spokes attached to the lattice wall around the outside and a small wooden ring in the center. The crown can be left open to the sky. The door is made next, either of a single piece of wood or of wooden slats fastened together to form a frame, which is then hung with heavy fabric. Finally, a waterproof covering is made and fitted over the walls and crown. If desired, stenciled designs can be added to the woodwork or covering.

Compositions published by musicians such as Tommy Turpin and Scott Joplin in the 1890s popularized the simple syncopated rhythm of this type of music, which was composed for piano. Ragtime pianists were in some ways similar to classical concert pianists, for they precisely struck each note printed on the page. The tempo of ragtime was very upbeat and energetic, if a bit mechanical -- some critics would even say boring -- in its routine delivery. In the first two decades of the 1900s, musicians began to build on ragtime tunes to create a different kind of music, which is now considered early jazz. Playing a variety of instruments including horns and piano, groups such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band improvised to embellish melodies, and a new music era emerged. Though ragtime is still performed today, its dominance as a genre subsided by about 1920.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

That means that it can be difficult to tell when melons are ready to eat. However, there are several key indicators that help distinguish ripe melons from unripe ones. One good test relies on smell. Melons such as cantaloupes have a sweet smell when ripe, especially on the end opposite from the stem, where they were once attached to the vine. Ripe melons can also be distinguished by subtle color or texture clues, visible upon careful inspection. For example, when selecting a watermelon, look for one with a dull exterior instead of a shiny one. For cantaloupe, it is important to detect an underlying yellow tint. Although the color of a cantaloupe’s net-like outermost layer doesn’t really vary, the layer below that is more golden, rather than green or white, when the melon is ripe.

Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?

A.	Cantaloupes and watermelons ripen differently from other fruit.

Sonora Smart Dodd, one of six children raised by a widowed father, wanted to establish an equivalent to Mother’s Day for male parents. She promoted the idea among community leaders, government officials, and shopkeepers in Washington State, which later recognized the first statewide Father’s Day in 1910. Father’s Day was slow to catch on across the country and did not really catch on until after World War II began. At that time, advertisers promoted it as an opportunity to honor U.S. troops and support the war effort, transforming it into a widely celebrated occasion.

This time period coincides with the emergence of the first agricultural societies in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East. Scientists believe that Middle Eastern wildcats preyed on rodents that were pillaging grain crops. People were pleased that the wildcats helped safeguard their harvest by keeping the mouse population under control. Furthermore, researchers speculate that, over time, humans began to adopt friendlier felines over other cats with less docile personalities. Eventually, this lead to genetic changes that also changed cats’ behaviors associated with memory, fear, and praise, and that’s how the ancient cat eventually evolved.

For about half of spider species, spinning a silk web is the principal way in which they catch prey. But not all webs work the same way. Some spiders spin the circular webs we might associate with spooky Halloween decorations. Often referred to as orb webs, these are sticky, wheel-shaped webs that trap insects. Sheet webs, on the other hand, include special non-sticky lines of silk that knock insects onto a horizontal flat surface below, which is more of a trap than an adhesive. Finally, some spiders spin funnel-shaped webs and hide in the narrow end of the funnel to better stockpile their prey, while others opt to hunt their prey without the use of webs. No matter what shape, if any, they spin, spiders design their webs to survive and thrive in the world.

This payment method for mailing letters and packages was the idea of Sir Rowland Hill of England. Before the invention of the stamp, the recipient of a letter would pay for each sheet of paper received and the distance traveled. Therefore, sending mail using this method was very costly. Hill argued instead for a single national rate of a penny to be paid by the sender. Hill’s suggestion was very popular with the public and was quickly implemented in British post offices. Use of stamps increased, and they sold in the tens of millions after becoming available on May 1, 1840. It did not take long for other countries to adopt a similar postage payment system.

By age 12, he had made a small rubber band-powered model of a helicopter that lifted into the air. In 1910, Sikorsky’s first serious attempts at building a full-scale helicopter unfortunately failed due to a lack of materials, money, and experience. He then decided to work on more feasible projects such as building airplanes. Over the next 30 years, Sikorsky developed a four-engine airplane and a giant flying boat. In 1939, he had procured the finances and recruited a crew of well-trained engineers ready to help him finally build his helicopter.

In the mid-1800s, John Curtis, an inventor from Maine, had the idea of selling chewing gum sticks made from spruce tree resin. Curtis added sugar to sweeten the flavor, and coated the exterior with cornstarch. However, even with the additional ingredients, spruce resin did not taste very good, and it became brittle after a few chews. An inventor from New York, Thomas Adams, had better results. The president of Mexico introduced Adams to a different type of natural material for gum, called chicle. Adams eventually used chicle to commercially manufacture chewing gum.

Following in his uncle’s footsteps, Laennec studied medicine to become a physician. The stethoscope was an accidental invention. Before the stethoscope, doctors had to place their ears directly on the patient’s body to hear heartbeats. To maintain greater propriety when diagnosing a female patient, Laennec rolled a few sheets of paper into a tube and placed it between his ear and the patient's chest. To his surprise, the sounds produced inside the chest were augmented through the use of this makeshift device. Laennec went home and bore a hollow tube through a cylindrical piece of wood, giving rise to the first of many stethoscope models.

According to the passage, Laennec first devised the makeshift stethoscope to

A.	uphold proper social behaviors.
B.	amplify his sense of hearing.

Over time, however, margarine’s popularity had a detrimental effect on the dairy industry’s profits. As a result, some in the dairy industry began to lobby for restrictions to be placed on margarine. They campaigned against the product, which they claimed destroyed family farms, contained contaminants, and caused cancer. In 1886, the Federal Margarine Act placed a special two-cent tax on margarine and required margarine manufacturers to pay a special license fee. Some state laws even stipulated that margarine must be dyed pink before made available for sale. Eventually, lawmakers loosened restrictions in 1949 after margarine manufacturers engaged in intense lobbying practices.

Based on the passage, what was one effect of the 1886 Federal Margarine Act?

A.	required that dye be added to margarine
B.	levied taxes and licensing fees on margarine
C.	required that contaminants be removed from margarine
D.	lifted restrictions on the sale and distribution of margarine

Before it gets to our tables, raw sugar cane must go through several stages of refinement. After being harvested, the canes are washed and shredded into chips, then crushed under roller mills. When the roller mills have finished squeezing out the cane juice, mill workers add chemicals to the juice that react with impurities and help remove unwanted material such as wax and fats. The purified juice is next boiled until it becomes a syrup, and the syrup is allowed to evaporate under controlled conditions until sugar crystals form. The crystals and any remaining liquid are spun in a rapidly rotating container to separate the two from each other. At this stage, the crystals are called “raw sugar” and are nearly pure sugar, coated with a fine layer of molasses. Because some consumers prefer pure white sugar crystals, raw sugar can be refined further to remove the traces of molasses.

Based on the passage, what do mill workers do immediately after cane juice is produced?

A.	Spin it in a rapidly rotating container.
B.	Add chemicals to react to impurities.
C.	Send it to a refinery for whitening.
D.	Boil it until it becomes a syrup.

He was a woodsman, a wild man fit to conquer and prevail in any wild land. He went now about the business he purposed as steadily as though he were well accustomed to it. With not even the slight assistance of an occasional star, he found the trunk of a giant poplar tree which had fallen -- perhaps he knew it from his many wanderings here. The bark upon the trunk was dry, and with the aid of a broken branch he loosed a long fold, sufficient for a roof when propped up on the trunk of the tree itself. He felt within the rotted trunk and drew out an armful of rotted but dry wood, which made him good floor enough for his bed, keeping him above the dampness. A part of it also offered punk for the tinder which he found within the breast of his own blouse. Here also were the primitive tools of the frontiersman in this land -- flint and steel. And with flint and steel David Joslin now managed to build himself a fire even in the dripping rain.

The passage suggests that David Joslin

A.	is a resourceful wilderness resident.

Leaves, then, are for something more than to provide the beautiful foliage which is their most spectacular accomplishment. So varied is this in its beauty, from plain green leaves to the wonderful coloring found in begonias, coleus, and many other garden plants, that the sheer beauty of the panorama of foliage is likely to blind us to the more important uses of leaves. First of all must we consider them the factories, in which night and day are produced the food of all plants and most animals. Then in certain cases we have seen that, by every ingenious device known to nature, they perform other special work, such as helping the plant to climb where that is necessary, catching or even capturing insects and digesting them when that peculiar service is demanded of them, and, finally, serving as storage reservoirs in regions where water is scarce.

The secret of strength in speech and writing lies in the art of using the right word in the right place; therefore, careful speakers and writers should aim to command not only a large vocabulary but a wide and correct knowledge of the meanings of words. These can be most readily acquired by noting the meaning of every new word across which one may come in reading, and by constantly consulting a dictionary, preferably one which compares or contrasts words in such a manner as to bring out clearly the finer and nicer distinctions in their meanings -- such distinctions as are necessary to the student to put him into possession of the essential differences of the words compared. Learn the meaning of words and your tongue will never slip.

Which of the following best restates the author’s main point?

A.	There is a precise strategy for using the correct word in a given context.
B.	A weak vocabulary often causes unintentional mistakes in one’s speech.

The recommended equipment for bouldering includes chalk to improve grip, durable rock-climbing shoes for better traction, and a thick mat, called a crash pad, for softer landings. The other requirement for bouldering is not a piece of equipment, but rather a person -- the spotter. The spotter observes a climbing partner while the climber ascends the boulder, and stands ready to redirect the climber’s fall to a safe landing on the crash pad. Before scaling the rock, a climber determines which path to take and chooses the endpoint location, or the location at which they will stop climbing. In many cases, the end point is the top of the wall or boulder, but not always. After determining an endpoint, the climber begins the ascent, using footholds to push upward and using handholds to pull upward. Generally, most bouldering does not take the climber higher than about fifteen feet above the ground.

According to the passage, the primary function of the spotter is to

A.	plan the climbing route.
B.	catch hold of the climber.
C.	redirect the climber’s fall.

He initially wanted the Cherokee language to include a writing system that had a unique symbol to represent each word. Eventually rejecting this concept as impractical, Sequoyah instead decided on a syllabary consisting of characters that would represent all 85 syllable sounds in the Cherokee language. Though Sequoyah borrowed Roman letters to represent some syllables in written form, many characters are Sequoyah’s own original invention. Shortly after the completion of Sequoyah’s syllabary in 1821, the Cherokee tribe adopted Sequoyah’s system and became the first group of Native Americans to implement their own alphabet and writing system. Sequoyah’s system for writing Cherokee became popular very quickly, and many important texts, including the newspaper of the Cherokee nation, were published using Sequoyah’s syllabary.

Grasshopper mice also consume other creatures for sustenance, including scorpions that have venomous stingers. How is it possible for these small mice to withstand the dangerous venom? Grasshopper mice have a unique genetic mutation that allows their systems to react to the venom as if it was a painkiller. Another interesting fact about grasshopper mice is that they howl at night to mark territory and ward off other mice. These cries are loud enough for a human to hear and can help the mice protect an area as large as eight acres, the equivalent of five city blocks. Grasshopper mice spend most of their days in underground burrows, some of which were previously dug by other animals, such as prairie dogs or kangaroo rats.

For this painting and others, da Vinci mastered a painting technique called chiaroscuro, which emphasizes the contrast between light and dark to achieve a greater sense of depth. In addition to his paintings, he also produced many drawings that explored anatomy, architectural design, and other subjects. His engineering studies allowed him to understand the complex interactions between moving parts. During his lifetime, da Vinci designed blueprints for automobiles and flying machines, which were not brought to production due to the technological limitations of his era. However, inventors in later centuries developed similar machines, proving the soundness of da Vinci’s engineering principles. In addition to knowledge of art and machines, da Vinci possessed an understanding of the human body that few others could demonstrate. He left behind a collection of medical research that could have advanced contemporary science if it had been published during his lifetime.

Perhaps the best known legend about the festival’s origin involves the commemoration of one of China’s early poets, Qu Yuan. When this patriotic poet drowned, it is said that the local people threw rice in the river, as nourishment for his spirit, and in later years organized dragon boat races in his honor. Over the last 25 years, this traditional festival has evolved into the international paddling sport of dragon boat racing. Because many of the racing watercrafts are decorated to look like dragons, the event showcases the artistic qualities of each team’s boat. For instance, a boat may feature colorful painted scales along the side and include paddles that represent the dragon’s claws. Teams of up to twenty paddlers, a steersperson, and a drummer -- who sets the pace and synchronizes the team’s paddle strokes by beating a drum -- partake in this annual racing competition.

However, the Chinese term for jade, yu, is more comprehensive and includes other jade-like minerals, such as serpentine and bowenite. Most people associate jade with Chinese culture, and with good reason. Jade has been highly prized, considered even more desirable than silver and gold, throughout China’s 7,000-year history. Once worn only by Chinese royalty, jade was used to craft luxurious objects associated with high status and symbolizing the strength and purity of their possessor. Admired for its translucent quality, jade was often associated with immortality and used as ornamentation in tombs. Each Chinese dynasty produced its own distinctive style of jade carving and design for jade objects. In the last thousand years, the production of jade items in China has expanded, and jade is used in everyday articles, such as vessels, sculptures, jewelry, furnishings, and toys.

Her work continues to be celebrated today, particularly her self-portraits for their raw feeling and emotional transparency. Unlike the work of her contemporaries, including her husband and fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera, Kahlo’s paintings depict the complexities of her life rather than a romanticized version of it. Revealing the tragedies she experienced allows viewers to relate to her and the powerful feelings behind her work. Hence, Kahlo’s self-portraits not only convey her own vulnerability, but also depict her inner strength and resilience. Although Kahlo’s work is recognized worldwide, the pieces she created are relatively small in size and often very humble. Nevertheless, what her art lacks in conventional beauty, it makes up for in character and spirit.

In the passage, the author’s purpose is most likely to

However, for the most part, availability of such water was limited to locals and visitors. The first drinkable artificial mineral water was supposedly created by Joseph Priestly, an English scientist who discovered a way to add carbon dioxide to plain water and published his results. Soon, inventors from many nations were looking for an efficient way to artificially produce mineral water in large quantities. The first U.S. patented device for this purpose was issued in 1810. However, sales in the U.S. didn’t become widespread until the 1830s, when inventor John Matthews mass-produced his device for producing carbonated water. Customers could then order glasses of mineral water in soda fountains, where drug stores put Matthews’s apparatus to work.

This annual practice was first required by federal law in 1918 during World War I as a way to conserve energy when resources were scarce. However, starting work an hour later in the day was very disruptive to farmers whose daily schedules revolved around the sun rising and setting. Congress repealed the law just one year later due to staunch opposition from agricultural groups. States, counties, and cities were then free to start and end daylight saving time whenever they chose. This resulted in a chaotic few decades in which a person could go through numerous time changes within one state. To resolve these confusing discrepancies, the Uniform Time Act of 1966 again standardized the start and stop dates for daylight saving time for the entire nation, but allowed states and territories to request exemptions from its observance.

Certainly not. It stands staring into vacancy, and asking, ""What kind of a thing do you wish me to remember?"" It needs in short, a cue. But, if I say, remember the date of your birth, or remember what you had for breakfast, or remember the succession of notes in the musical scale; then your faculty of memory immediately produces the required result: the 'cue' determines its vast set of potentialities toward a particular point.

It is customary to call them all alike “stars.” But since the planets more or less rapidly change their places in the sky, in consequence of their revolution about the sun, while the stars proper seem to remain always in the same relative positions, the latter are spoken of as “fixed stars.” In the beginnings of astronomy it was not known that the “fixed stars” had any motion independent of their apparent annual revolution with the whole sky about the earth as a seeming center. Now, however, we know that the term “fixed stars” is paradoxical, for there is not a single really fixed object in the whole celestial sphere.

The process preserves food for years, and only water is needed to return the food to its original state. The first step in freeze-drying is the preparation of food: any contaminants are cleaned off, and the food is cut into pieces and cooked if necessary. The prepared food is then arranged on trays, which are placed into a special chamber. The temperature of the chamber is quickly lowered until the food is frozen solid, after which a vacuum pump drastically reduces the pressure within the chamber. Over the course of hours, a small amount of heat is then applied to the bottom of the trays, causing the ice crystals trapped within the food to change directly into water vapor, which is removed from the chamber. When this process is finished, the freeze-dried food is packaged into airtight containers to prevent it from absorbing moisture. Later, the food can be rehydrated and enjoyed.

Based on the passage, what step occurs immediately after the pressure within the chamber is reduced?

It was most likely the Chinese who first made wood-framed umbrellas waterproof. They coated silk or paper umbrellas with wax and lacquer derived from tree sap that hardened into a solid protective layer. The umbrella spread to the western world and was popular in the 1500s with European women who carried them as fashion accessories as well as protection against unfavorable weather. By the 1700s, an Englishman named Jonas Hanway started carrying an umbrella and eventually popularized the use of umbrellas among men. In the mid-1800s, steel frames began to replace wood in umbrellas, making them much lighter and easier to use. The steel frames also led to the invention of the folding compact umbrella in the 1900s. While the materials, mechanization, and styles continue to evolve, the fundamental design of the umbrella remains the same.

Which of the following best describes the order of umbrella innovations, from first to last?

A.	compact collapsible, steel framed, wood framed, waterproof
B.	compact collapsible, wood framed, steel framed, waterproof
C.	wood framed, steel framed, waterproof, compact collapsible

The villagers who lived in the Atri region were impoverished, had limited water and services, and had to travel miles over a narrow path or around the mountain to access hospitals and schools in the adjacent town of Wazirganj. In the mid 1900s, one local man named Dashrath Manjhi decided to carve out a more direct path leading into Wazirganj. Manjhi had no help from the local government or investors, and he had no special tools. Instead, he relied on a hammer and chisel, using his own physical labor to break through the rock. Manjhi worked for twenty-two years boring through the mountain without assistance or power-driven equipment. Finally, his 30-foot-wide road was completed, and the villagers were able to traverse the new, shorter route into town on cycles and motorcycles, as well as on foot.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	Manjhi wanted the new road to be built without modern equipment.
B.	Manjhi helped people throughout India with his road-building talents.
C.	Manjhi’s road helped make life in the Atri region safer and more convenient.

This event can be celebrated in different ways depending on the region, but the festivities usually include lots of lights set around the home and garden. Traditionally, children light small oil lamps that they make out of clay, but in modern times the lights may take many different forms. Some people light candles or gather to enjoy fireworks displays. Others even illuminate their homes with bright neon lights. Because Diwali is also the Indian New Year, new beginnings are celebrated. People often refresh their wardrobes, pay off debts, or thoroughly clean their homes to mark this auspicious occasion. Food is another important part of Diwali. Families and friends feast on traditional foods, and celebrators hand out sweet treats and firecrackers. For many families, Diwali is a day of thankfulness.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	Diwali is celebrated as the Indian New Year.

Rosemary is an especially popular herb that is easy to grow and can be used in a variety of dishes. Gardeners typically harvest rosemary right before the plant is about to flower. The best time of day to harvest is late in the morning after the dew has evaporated and the plant is free of moisture. A good rule of thumb is to cut rosemary stems of similar length, wash them under cold water, then tie the stems in a bundle for easy hanging. Covering the bundle with a perforated brown paper bag will keep the dust off while still allowing for air circulation. Once the stems are brittle to the touch, the leaves should be removed and stored in airtight jars. Because rosemary maintains most of its qualities throughout the drying process, gardeners can enjoy its bold, piney aroma and flavor in their favorite dishes.

According to the passage, gardeners typically harvest rosemary

A.	while the leaves are moist with dew.
B.	once the stems are brittle to the touch.

The type of sweet decoration that bakers use depends largely on what they’re baking. Because its base is typically cream or butter, frosting has a thicker, fluffier appearance. This means frosting holds its shape better than icing, allowing frosting to be applied to cakes with a spatula or knife. Icing, on the other hand, is usually made with a sugar or egg white base. Before it hardens, this thin and glossy topping has a consistency closer to that of a liquid, which means that bakers typically apply it with a piping bag onto cookies, scones, or other baked goods. Despite the differences, though, both icing and frosting remain popular among bakers and confection connoisseurs alike.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	argue for the use of frosting over icing on baked goods.

From a small town in northeastern Mississippi, Howlin’ Wolf encountered several notable blues musicians in his adolescent years, including Charley Patton and Aleck Miller. These meetings inspired Howlin’ Wolf to pursue a career in music, specifically the blues, and, in 1948, he became a notable radio personality. Armed with his harmonica, Howlin’ Wolf showcased his band’s unique musical stylings on his own fifteen-minute radio show. In the years following his breakout as a radio personality, Howlin’ Wolf rose to such acclaim that world-renowned artists began recording his songs.

Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar -- except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path.

It cast its eyes upon the roads, which were growing from long troughs of liquid mud to proper thoroughfares.

The task of writing an autobiography is a difficult one. When I try to classify my earliest impressions, I find that fact and fancy look alike across the years that link the past with the present. The woman paints the child's experiences in her own fantasy. A few impressions stand out vividly from the first years of my life; but “the shadows of the prison-house are on the rest.” Besides, many of the joys and sorrows of childhood have lost their poignancy; and many incidents of vital importance in my early education have been forgotten in the excitement of great discoveries.

Foot passengers, jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke (if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.

This pepper comes from various species of pepper plants that are now cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world, but that are native to southern India and Sri Lanka. The berries of the plant, called peppercorns when dried, are used whole or ground. Historically, pepper was a significant part of the spice trade with India and was prized in Medieval Europe. Because the pepper traveled to Europe all the way from India, it was very rare, costly, and considered an amenity reserved for the wealthy. In fact, peppercorns were at one time so valuable that they were used as a form of currency. Not just a condiment, pepper--like many pungent spices--was used medicinally by Indians, Greeks, Romans, and the Chinese as a remedy for digestive disorders and other illnesses. Today, pepper is one of the most popular spices and can be found on almost every dining table in the United States.

There are many interesting theories about why we yawn, but the exact cause or causes remain a bit of a mystery. In ancient Greece, Hippocrates thought that yawning released bad air from the lungs. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, scientists began to consider the possibility that yawning was related to the circulatory system and that it increased blood pressure, heart rate, and the level of oxygen in the blood. More recent studies about yawning suggest that the body induces yawning to decrease brain temperature. Even a slight increase in brain temperature can decrease a person’s reaction time and impede memory. Yawning might also serve a social function by indicating our mental state--perhaps bored or tired -- to those around us.

Bats sleep hanging upside down from the cave’s ceiling, where they are inaccessible to most of their predators. Cave bats are beneficial to other cave dwellers, such as tiny crustaceans and other organisms that feed on the fungi and bacteria that grow on bat waste matter, called guano.

An 11-year-old named Venetia Burney was interested in astronomy and in Greek and Roman mythology. In 1930, when her grandfather, Falconer Madan, told her about the not-yet-named discovery of what was then considered the ninth planet from the sun, Burney immediately thought of naming it Pluto, for the Roman god of the underworld. Madan was a friend of an astronomy professor, Herbert Hall Turner, who suggested the name to the discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, at Lowell Observatory. The name Pluto found favor with Tombaugh and others at the observatory because it shared its first two letters with the initials of the observatory’s founder, Percival Lowell. Used over the years since then to name things as unalike as a cartoon dog and a new element in the periodic table--plutonium--Pluto was a widely popular choice for the new discovery.

To ascertain the freshness of an egg without breaking it, hold your hand around the egg toward a bright light or the sun and look through it. If the yolk appears quite round and the white clear, it is fresh. Or, if you put it in a bucket of water and it falls on its side, it is fresh. If it sort of topples in the water, standing on its end, it is fairly fresh, but, if it floats, beware of it. The shell of a fresh egg looks dull and porous. As it begins to age, the shell takes on a shiny appearance. If an egg is kept any length of time, a portion of its water evaporates, which leaves a space in the shell, and the egg will “rattle.” An egg that rattles may be perfectly good, and still not absolutely fresh.

Based on the passage, think twice about eating an egg if

A.	it rattles inside its shell when shaken.

Between the years 2000 and 1800 BC the primitive metalworkers discovered that bronze, a mixture of tin and copper, was a more suitable metal than pure copper for the manufacture of weapons; and the first period of the bronze age may be dated from 1800 to 1500 BC. The bronze celts at first differed little from those made of copper, but gradually the type developed from the plain wedge-shaped celt to the beautiful socketed celt, which appears on the scene in the last, or fifth, division of the bronze age (900-350 BC). It was during the age of bronze that spears came into general use, as did the sword and rapier. The early spear-heads were simply knife-shaped bronze weapons riveted to the ends of shafts, but by degrees the graceful socketed spear-heads of the late bronze age were developed.

In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all, there is such a thing as matter. Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very prolonged dream? This question is of the greatest importance. For if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot be sure of the independent existence of other people’s bodies, and therefore still less of other people’s minds, since we have no grounds for believing in their minds except such as are derived from observing their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we shall be left alone in a desert--it may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist. This is an uncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved to be false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true.

Smooth, circular leaves growing upwards of nine to ten inches in diameter provide shelter for aquatic animals and surround each aromatic blossom. Growing in dense colonies, the water lily plant produces two- to six-inch-wide flowers that open at dawn, closing for the day in the early afternoon. Blooming season occurs during peak summer months, and pollination is done by insects. After two to five days of opening and closing, a flower closes for the final time, producing a fruit containing seeds that will eventually ripen below the surface of the water.

According to the passage, the water lily’s flower

A.	closes in the early afternoon.
B.	provides shelter for aquatic animals.
C.	floats just below the water’s surface.

Historically, farming families on the islands relied on shelties to provide grounds maintenance, including keeping livestock from gardens, herding flocks of sheep, and providing warning when unwelcome visitors drew near. When the dogs were introduced to the British mainland, however, they were also used as guardian dogs to provide companionship for city dwellers. Eventually, the Shetland sheepdog arrived in the United States in 1908 and was officially accepted as a breed a few years later. Widely recognized by breed officials as remarkably trainable, responsive, and obedient, shelties have since been used as medical assistance dogs, and they are regularly entered into a variety of dog competitions, including national herding trials.

According to the passage, shelties were initially used for

The most common type is known as the bigleaf hydrangea, which can grow upwards of six feet tall and is especially admired for its bountiful blossoms. Like all hydrangeas, the bigleaf thrives in moist, well-drained soils, in sun to partial shade, although sufficient sunlight is required to produce flowers. A few hardy varieties, such as the panicle hydrangeas, can flourish in sunny and hot conditions, but they still require regular watering. The color of hydrangea flowers can range anywhere from blue to pink, red, or white, and it is directly influenced by the acidity of the planting soil. To decrease acidic conditions, when pink flowers are desired, gardeners typically add lime to the soil. However, for higher acidic soil, gardeners can add aluminum sulfate or acidic organic matter and enjoy blue blooms midsummer through fall.

According to the passage, to achieve pink hydrangea blooms, a gardener should

A.	adjust the soil by adding lime.
B.	provide more acidic planting soil.
C.	water hydrangeas more frequently.

These nocturnal, winged beetles are known for their vibrant displays of light, which are entirely heat-free, and originate from the underside of their abdomen. This phenomenon is a result of a reaction involving oxygen and other chemicals in the body of the firefly--most importantly luciferase and luciferin. Among fireflies, the emittance of light is used primarily as a mating signal between males and females, and it also serves to warn away predators who have experienced the firefly’s unpleasant taste. While scientists continue to investigate the biological mechanisms responsible for this dazzling phenomenon, the study of luciferase and luciferin in fireflies has advanced the scientific community’s understanding of heat-free light emittance.

According to the passage, the emittance of light from fireflies is

A.	a result of their living in warm, moist climates.
B.	accompanied by an increase in temperature.

Less familiar is the idea that trail construction projects that facilitate such activities have a positive economic impact on the areas around these outdoor recreational spaces. Trails created for biking and hiking encourage visitor spending at local eateries, small businesses, and lodging establishments, thus increasing tax revenues in the regional community. They also make the community more attractive to prospective business owners who may be considering relocation or expansion. The influx of activity around new trails can even boost property values in surrounding neighborhoods. When all types of outdoor activities are considered, millions of jobs are supported and billions of dollars are contributed to the United States economy every year, making outdoor recreation places not only a great place to spend vacation time, but a pillar of community development and prosperity.

Which of the following conclusions is suggested by the passage?

A.	Opportunities to purchase a new home near a recreational space are limited. 
B.	Communities with many hiking and biking trails are perceived as expensive.

For example, miniature horses have been used to guide visually impaired people and to serve as therapy animals for seniors and children. The longer life span of these calm animals, compared to dogs, means the investment in training them makes economic sense. Similarly, capuchin monkeys, who can live 20 to 30 years, provide long term assistance to people who have severely impaired mobility. A service monkey can perform simple tasks that require dexterity, giving their companions a sense of independence. Even pot-bellied pigs have been trained to help owners by performing tasks similar to those that we’re accustomed to seeing service dogs perform. It is heart-warming that so many types of animals can form relationships with and provide assistance to people who need them.

Based on the passage, miniature horses are cost effective service animals because they

The tubular flowers come in various shades of white to pink to purple on the outside and feature dark purple spots and white patches on the inside. Long used by folk medicine practitioners as a cure for sore throats or to make a soothing compress, medical researchers later discovered foxglove to be a source of chemical compounds that stimulate the heart and kidneys. During the 1700s, English physician William Withering observed heart-specific effects of foxglove extract, particularly that it strengthened heart muscle contractions. Withering had knowledge of a local folk healer treating a patient with herbs. Intrigued by the patient’s miraculous recovery, Withering examined the herbs that the healer used and determined that foxglove was a primary ingredient. Since Withering’s discovery, digitalis--that is, the cardiac medication derived from foxglove--is used to treat a variety of heart-related issues.

The passage suggests that Withering’s investigation into the medical use of common foxglove

A.	contributed greatly to modern cardiac care.

Though the patch as we know it--a commemorative fabric emblem--was popularized within only the last 200 years, insignias were used to show familial, cultural, or communal affiliation since before the first century. Later, Romans, Greeks, and select groups of people during the Middle Ages adopted similar signs of commitment, observing various pilgrimages with metal badges. In the nineteenth century, travelers began purchasing items as reminders of their adventures, while the next hundred years saw Europeans begin decorating their hiking gear with resort town patches, a trend that was soon adopted in the United States as the rise of national parks began calling more people outdoors.

This climbing orchid can reach up to 80 feet tall in warm tropical and subtropical countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, Hawaii, and Tahiti. The orchid bloom, which in the wild is pollinated by bees but at a very low success rate, must be hand-pollinated by cultivators no later than 12 hours after blooming, which occurs only during a 24-hour period. If pollination is not successful, the flower drops, and the pod, which is produced only when the plant is a mature 10 feet or more, is lost. Once the orchid is pollinated and the plant reaches a bean-bearing height, the vanilla pods mature within approximately five months, and are cured, fermented, and dried to produce essential oil and extract.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

Its origin dates back to World War I when the head of the Food Administration, future President Herbert Hoover, asked U.S. citizens to cut back on meat, fat, sugar, and wheat products in order to reserve food to feed soldiers and needy people of Allied nations. Businesses and private citizens embraced the effort, with over eleven million American families signing a pledge in November 1917 to observe Meatless Tuesdays and Wheatless Wednesdays. Ultimately, the campaign was successful, having achieved a fifteen percent reduction in food consumption in American homes between 1918 and 1919. Today, some people advocate following the same weekly restrictions to reduce levels of saturated fat in their diets and enhance community health.

These CDs work a lot like savings accounts because they allow savers to earn interest on deposits at banks and credit unions. However, the key difference between a CD and a traditional savings account is that most CDs require you to leave your money in the account for a set period of time--that is, until it matures--or you could face fines for early withdrawals. CD investors earn higher interest rates than they would for conventional savings accounts. In general, the longer your CD takes to mature, the higher the interest rate. CDs are some of the safest investments available because they are not subject to the ups and downs of the stock market and are usually insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. CDs can be an attractive investment option for those looking for a dependable place to store their money while earning interest along the way.

President Roosevelt speaks as he writes. That tells the story. He makes no pretense to being an orator. Critics sometimes say that his books are not “literature,” by which they apparently mean words strung together to sound well. They are not. But what he writes no one can misunderstand, and the style seems to the reader unimportant, though it is notably direct, terse and vigorous. When he speaks, there is not often much applause, and when there is, he often raises his hand with a warning gesture to stop it. Both his hearers and he are much too interested in the thing he says to pay great heed to the way he says it. But when it is over, his hearers go away, thinking.

It was difficult to keep milk from spoiling because, prior to the 1900s, home refrigeration was not common. After some experimentation, Borden found that milk was more than three-quarters water. He looked for ways to vaporize the water so that only a more concentrated milk product would remain. Boiling the milk directly over a heat source using an open container burned and discolored the milk, as others had learned, so Borden tried boiling the water off using an airtight method and a “vacuum pan.” He was successful, and for the first time, many families could safely store milk for longer periods of time.

At the time, the French government offered a monetary award of 12,000 francs to anyone who could develop a practical method for preserving food. Determined to win the government prize, Appert experimented for over a decade before he was able to successfully formulate a way to keep perishable foods from spoiling. He found that if he loosely sealed the food in a glass bottle using a cork, immersed the bottle in boiling water for a few hours, and then secured the bottle with wax and wire to make it airtight, the food could be preserved for much longer than previously possible. Although Appert had no formal education and could not explain why this process worked, he achieved the goal and thus earned the prize money, using it to open a canning factory in 1812. Appert invented numerous other products, including the bouillon cube, but he is best known as the father of canning.

Over time, the tools used to project these lights have improved. For example, placing some type of reflector behind an oil lamp to send more light seaward was a significant improvement over using an oil lamp alone. However, even the highest quality parabolic type of reflector was only able to project about forty percent of the light emitted from the source. An important breakthrough occurred in the 1820s when Augustin Fresnel, a French physicist, developed a glass lens that encircled the light source. Named for its inventor, the Fresnel lens was revolutionary because it utilized about eighty percent of the light emitted from a lamp. Furthermore, the multi-faceted lens could produce unique patterns of light, making it easier for mariners to distinguish one lighthouse from another. The Fresnel lens was truly an invaluable contribution to maritime technology.

At an early age, Ransom began working in the family’s machine shop and developed a fascination with mechanical devices. There, he created a small steam engine that had a gas burner and was more efficient than existing coal- or wood-burning steam engines. His dislike of horses, which were the main method of transportation at the time, motivated Ransom to experiment with attaching his steam engines to carriages. Eventually he was able to get a carriage using two of the engines to travel 15 miles per hour. After being inspired by the all-gasoline engines he saw at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893, Ransom started building internal combustion gas engines for his vehicles. Several years later, he established a motor vehicle company and, in 1901, produced 425 vehicles manufactured with gasoline engines, achieving commercial success with cars mass-produced on an assembly line for the first time in American history.

The original marshmallow candy, made in ancient Egypt, was a mixture of honey boiled with sap extracted from the plant’s roots. It wasn’t until the 1800s, when French candy makers added egg whites to the marshmallow mixture and manually whipped it and formed individual treats, that marshmallows developed their pillow-like texture. The treats were so popular that candy makers needed a way to make marshmallows more quickly and began using machine-made molds--trays of starch imprinted with cylindrical shapes. At the same time, the plant sap was replaced with gelatin. Then, in 1948, the extrusion process was developed, and the manufacturing of marshmallows became even faster. With this method, the marshmallow mixture is sent through tubes and then cut to length. This continues to be the method by which most marshmallows are made today.

At the start of the twentieth century, Hubert Cecil Booth, a British engineer, invented an interesting type of vacuum cleaner--one made of parts so large they had to be moved from customer to customer by a horse-drawn carriage. Born in 1871, Booth studied engineering in college. Working first for a firm that designed engines and then for a different firm that designed big wheels similar to the Ferris wheel, a new and popular fairground attraction at the time, Booth gained experience in design. His first attempt to engineer a vacuum cleaner was inspired after he witnessed a demonstration of an ineffective machine designed to clean rail cars. That machine blew out pressurized air and stirred up dust and debris. Convinced that he could develop a better product that would draw up dirt using suction, Booth created a suction pump attached to a hollow container that could run on oil or coal because there were not many houses wired with electricity at the time, in 1901. Booth’s venture evolved into a company that rented out vacuuming services, even cleaning a carpet in Westminster Abbey in preparation for a royal coronation.

According to the passage, Booth conceived of the idea to build a vacuum cleaner

A.	during his first job designing engines.

On very rare occasions, a natural genetic mutation, all on its own, will produce a seedless fruit that has the desired characteristics of its seeded counterparts. Two examples of the latter are the navel orange and the Thompson seedless grape. All navel orange trees are clones of a single seedless mutation that occurred in Brazil in 1820. Because the clones cannot develop seeds, navel orange trees are propagated using cuttings from a parent tree’s branches. Similarly, the popular Thompson seedless grape, grown in California since 1872, also resulted from a natural mutation, in this case a genetic abnormality in which the seeds never fully form after fertilization. New Thompson seedless grape plants are grown by planting cuttings from a parent vine.

According to the passage, which of the following is a correct statement about navel oranges?

A.	They have the same mutation as Thompson seedless grapes.
B.	They are seedless because of a natural mutation.

The change from solid to gas can create a smoke-like effect, making it ideal for simulating fog or smoke in movies or plays. However, the primary use of dry ice is to keep foods cool, particularly during transport. Shippers often use dry ice rather than regular ice, which leaves a liquid mess after melting. Carbon dioxide freezes at -109 degrees Fahrenheit, and, if used with proper insulation, a block of dry ice will last for up to 72 hours. There are cautions to using dry ice, however. When dry ice is left in an enclosed space that has no ventilation, the change from solid to carbon dioxide gas can make the air toxic. Additionally, dry ice must be handled carefully with gloves because it is so cold. After just a few seconds of contact with bare skin, it can cause frostbite.

When any science becomes an independent discipline, it is recognized that it is a more or less limited field in which work of a certain kind is done in a certain way. Other fields and other kinds of work are to some extent ignored. But it is quite to be expected that there should be some dispute, especially at first, as to what does or does not properly fall within the limits of a given science. Where these limits shall be placed is, after all, a matter of convenience; and sometimes it is not well to be too strict in marking off one field from another. It is well to watch the actual development of a science, and to note the direction instinctively taken by investigators in that particular field.

Based on the passage, the view of the author is most likely that

A.	disciplines should be limited to investigators with expertise in the field.

There cannot be two sets of ethical principles, one for life in the school, and the other for life outside of the school. As conduct is one, so also the principles of conduct are one. The tendency to discuss the morals of the school as if the school were an institution by itself is highly unfortunate. The moral responsibility of the school, and of those who conduct it, is to society. The school is fundamentally an institution erected by society to do a certain specific work,--to exercise a certain specific function in maintaining the life and advancing the welfare of society. The educational system which does not recognize that this fact entails upon it an ethical responsibility is derelict and a defaulter. It is not doing what it was called into existence to do, and what it pretends to do.

MyPlate is a diagram featuring a plate and cup divided into color-coded portions that represent fruits, vegetables, proteins, grains, and dairy. The recommended intake of each type of food group or nutrient depends on a person’s age, gender, and exercise routine. Based on the rendering, MyPlate suggests that half of each meal should consist of fruits and vegetables. It also recommends that at least half of the grains a person consumes should be whole rather than refined. Furthermore, MyPlate guidelines encourage choosing a wider variety of protein sources, including leaner or lower-fat meats, seafood, and vegetarian options such as beans. For many adults, dairy should also be fat free or low fat. MyPlate is one of several online resources that can support people trying to make healthier decisions about their eating habits.

Both Bradford’s and Franklin’s publications ceased after a few months, and most magazines that followed were locally focused and short lived. However, thanks to favorable postal rates and general growth in the economy after the Civil War, magazine publishing flourished in the U.S. during the late 1800s. For a time, there was a clear distinction between expensive magazines printed for more refined audiences and cheaper publications, but Samuel Sidney McClure bridged that gap in 1893 with the publication of McClure’s Magazine. At 15 cents per issue, McClure’s sold for a fraction of the more expensive magazines that cost between 25 and 35 cents per issue, and contained quality fiction and well-written articles invested in social issues. Though it permanently ceased publication in 1929, McClure’s was one of the first popular monthly magazines to reach a mass market, and it led a revolution in the magazine industry.

While the recommendations for exactly how much sleep kids should get have changed over the years, the reasons behind the shuteye shortfall are not that dissimilar, they’ve just been changed by technology. While radio and books were the culprits back in the early 1900s, today, television, video games, and text messages keep kids up past bedtime. Research suggests that lack of sleep can lead to a host of health concerns. These include depression, increased irritability, and risk for obesity, as well as lower levels of concentration. So, to improve their overall health and well-being, children should be encouraged to spend less time in front of the screen and more time catching up on sleep.

The population of this small, silvery blue butterfly dwindled down to a few hundred due to habitat loss and degradation. Interestingly, efforts to suppress wildfires were detrimental to the only food source eaten by the larvae of this butterfly, wild blue lupine plant leaves. Without periodic wildfires, the open spaces supporting lupine growth were not preserved, and encroaching trees were not kept in check. Recently, thanks to years of habitat restoration and breeding programs, the species has been making a comeback. These programs exist, in part, because of the research and funding behind the Endangered Species Act. The Karner blue butterfly was listed as an endangered species in 1992 because of its diminishing numbers, but because of the continued work of ecologists and other conservation advocates, experts say the Karner blue butterfly population may make a full recovery.

Simply put, several factors in combination were responsible. In the decades prior, increasing wheat prices, a few rainy seasons that created strong farm profits, and federal farm policies that encouraged development, drove farmers to the Southern Plains. There, in states such as Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, farmers used cultivation practices that were not appropriate for the soil of their new land. Wheat prices fell in 1930 as the Great Depression came on and drought dried up the once-fertile plains, revealing that the land was not suited for the volume and type of farming that it was now trying to support. Because the land had already been overgrazed and compromised by agricultural methods that were intended for different climates, the drought eventually contributed to a series of massive, deadly dust storms that led to one of the worst manmade ecological catastrophes in American history.

Similar to other turtles, this species has not changed much in terms of its body design over the last 210 million years, and it has the ability to live for decades and reproduce at advanced ages. The western painted turtle’s claim to fame, however, is that in the freshwater ponds of its natural habitat, it can completely freeze and survive without oxygen during winter months while hibernating, then thaw, maintaining healthy function of its heart and brain. Scientists researching this species have sequenced its genome, making it the first turtle with a complete set of DNA to study. Though many vertebrates, including humans, actually share some of the turtle’s genes, the activation of the turtle’s genes seems to be unique.

In notebooks, in newspapers, in handbooks of literature, summaries of one kind or another may be indispensable, and for children in primary schools it is a useful exercise to retell a story in their own words. But in the criticism or interpretation of literature the writer should be careful to avoid dropping into summary. He may find it necessary to devote one or two sentences to indicating the subject, or the opening situation, of the work he is discussing; he may cite numerous details to illustrate its qualities. But he should aim to write an orderly discussion supported by evidence, not a summary with occasional comment. Similarly, if the scope of his discussion includes a number of works, he will as a rule do better not to take them up singly in chronological order, but to aim from the beginning at establishing general conclusions.

For example, studies consistently show that positive life experiences give us lasting pleasure over material things such as a new car. Research also shows that spending money on others and giving it away to charitable causes can help make us happier. Moreover, buying time for ourselves by outsourcing tasks we don’t enjoy, such as house cleaning or running errands, can help us free up quality time to spend with family and friends. Therefore, consider forgoing an unneeded purchase and instead donate what you would have spent on a shopping spree to a charitable cause, or pay the neighbor across the street to mow your lawn and consider spending that saved time with your family or friends instead.

A perfect choice for those seeking a hardy addition to their garden, this plant should be grown in small pots from cuttings of a parent plant, then transplanted after roots form to a permanent location. If you feel lucky, you may plant seeds, but be prepared for a low germination rate. Transplant after the last frost, and be sure to provide dry, sandy, well-drained soil. Remember to avoid over-fertilizing, because extra soil nutrients can result in many leaves but fewer flowers. The English lavender plant is drought-tolerant, but water it regularly during the flowering period to help produce the most blooms. Despite its name, the plant is actually native to the Mediterranean region, not England, but likely earned the misnomer due to its success in the English climate. As long as you care for it and prune it annually, count on enjoying your fragrant plant for up to 15 years.

Such activity demands enormous amounts of energy and frequent consumption of high-calorie foods. However, nourishment for the hummingbird usually includes only flower nectar, pollen, tree sap, and small insects. When its food options are limited or in minimal supply, these extra-small birds will sometimes enter into a deep sleep-like state called torpor. Torpor allows the bird to rest by slowing metabolic functions and lowering body temperatures, which helps conserve energy whenever food sources are scarce or temperatures in its environment are low.

Although it is a member of the canine family, along with wolves, foxes, and dogs, it is not a member of the genus Canis, the scientific classification for true wolves. Unlike true wolves, the maned wolf is very timid and solitary, and is aggressive only when hunting. During a hunt, maned wolves listen for prey by rotating their large ears, and bring small birds, rodents, and frogs out of hiding by tapping the ground with their front feet. Interestingly, and similar to some true wolves who are also not solely meat eaters, maned wolves are known to eat fruits.

While both ingredients are used to make batter rise or leaven, their use in certain recipes can yield very different results. Baking soda--which is almost four times stronger than baking powder--is a base comprised solely of sodium bicarbonate. Bases chemically neutralize acids; when introduced to an acid such as lemon juice or buttermilk, baking soda immediately bubbles and produces carbon dioxide, neutralizing the acid, and in the process causing the batter to rise. For fluffy baked goods that lack acidic ingredients, bakers should use baking powder, which is a combination of baking soda, powdered acid, and starch. Ideally, if there is some but not enough acid for baking soda alone to be used to achieve the desired leavening, a recipe will call for both baking powder and baking soda. Note that acid that is left unneutralized will add a bit of tang to the flavor of the finished product.

The passage suggests that a person developing a recipe for baked goods should

A.	ensure that all acidic elements are completely neutralized.

Manufacturers place locally grown roses and water in a sealed kettle called a still, then subject the mixture to a process called steam distillation, which separates the oil from the rose petals using steam. Only rose oil that is made from fresh roses by steam distillation can be called attar of roses. One reason some rose-scented perfume is so expensive is that it takes hundreds of pounds of roses to produce a small amount of attar of roses. The water remaining from this process, called rose water, also has value because it contains trace amounts of rose oil. In France and Morocco, rose oil is produced primarily through extraction. During this process, a solvent is used instead of steam to separate the oil from the petals, and the oil product is called rose absolute.

With good reason, the cholla is also colloquially known as the “jumping cactus.” While the cactus doesn’t actually launch itself at passersby, its segmented joints are loosely attached to the main trunk, and even the slightest brush can result in a piece of cholla two to four inches long painfully settling on your skin, or even your dog’s curious nose. Furthermore, the cholla’s inch-long spines are hollow, which allows them to attach more easily to whatever they encounter. The plant’s sole mechanism for propagating is via cholla joints that fall to the ground.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about the Teddy Bear Cholla is correct?

A.	Its joints easily detach from the trunk.
B.	Its hollow spines are two to four inches long. 
C.	Its fruit drops to the ground to produce new plants.
D.	Its name comes from soft hairs that cover its surface.

Although lightning seems to happen very suddenly, meteorologists are often able to predict the likelihood of intense lightening activity and issue warnings when a severe thunderstorm is heading to your area. In the event of such a warning, first calmly make your way indoors. Homes, offices, or shopping centers are all safe retreats. Gather any available disaster supplies, such as flashlights, batteries, and a battery-operated radio, just in case a power outage occurs. Tune in to your local radio station and, once the storm arrives, avoid contact with running water and devices that are plugged into electrical outlets. Also, stay away from doors and windows and avoid leaning against concrete walls or lying on concrete floors, because lightening can travel through the metal reinforcement contained within the concrete. After the storm passes, check on your neighbors or people nearby who may need help and continue to listen for news updates and information about post-storm services.

Based on the passage, what should a person do just after finding refuge indoors?

A.	Stay away from doors and windows.
B.	Tune in to your local weather station.
C.	Gather any available disaster supplies.
D.	Offer your assistance to people nearby.

Most philatelists drift into stamp-collecting--that is to say, the start is made unconsciously, and without any definite planning. Probably the first specimens are obtained through the generosity of a friend who possesses a few duplicates, or may be the letters coming regularly from a relative living in some remote part of the world supply the earliest treasures. But however the beginning is made, progress will be slow unless friends are very generous or a little money is spent on buying sufficient specimens to make a fair start. In the ordinary course, the collector will be wise if he spends a few shillings on buying a packet of the commoner stamps which form the basis of all collections.

Looking out of the car window one day, I saw the pretty and unusual sight of an eagle sitting upon the ice in the river, surrounded by half a dozen or more crows. The crows appeared as if looking up to the noble bird and attending his movements. “Are those its young?” asked a gentleman by my side. How much did that man know--not about eagles, but about Nature? If he had been familiar with geese or hens, or with donkeys, he would not have asked that question. The ancients had an axiom that he who knew one truth knew all truths; so much else becomes knowable when one vital fact is thoroughly known. You have a key, a standard, and cannot be deceived. Chemistry, geology, astronomy, natural history, all admit one to the same measureless interiors.

Though he was only two feet tall, Pudge weighed almost 120 pounds, most of which was muscle. However, despite his intimidating size, Pudge was an anxious creature. When he was a puppy, he was afraid of almost everything. Once, Pudge’s caretaker, Sarah, heard Pudge yelp and rushed out to see what had spooked him. Sarah looked for Pudge for several minutes before discovering him frozen in fear at the sight of a mere spinning pinwheel. Another time, the smoke detector in the house sounded off because Sarah had forgotten to replace the batteries. When Pudge heard the shrill series of long and short beeps from the smoke detector, he swiftly crawled under Sarah’s desk to hide, eventually climbing onto her lap and staring at Sarah with eyes that begged for a safe place to hide.

I sat wondering: Why is there always this deep shade of melancholy over the fields’ arid river banks, the sky and the sunshine of our country? And I came to the conclusion that it is because with us Nature is obviously the more important thing. The sky is free, the fields limitless; and the sun merges them into one blazing whole. In the midst of this, man seems so trivial. He comes and goes, like the ferry-boat, from this shore to the other; the babbling hum of his talk, the fitful echo of his song, is heard; the slight movement of his pursuit of his own petty desires is seen in the world's market-places: but how feeble, how temporary, how tragically meaningless it all seems amidst the immense aloofness of the Universe!

2070.	Plants in the subfamily Tillandsioideae, commonly called air plants, grow naturally in parts of North, South, and Central America. They are a decorative mainstay in home or office settings because they do not require soil for growth. In the wild, air plants attach themselves to trees or rocks with structures that look like roots, but that lack the plant tissues true roots must have to carry water and nutrients. Air plants thus use these structures primarily to support themselves, and must absorb moisture and vital nutrients through their leaves. Because they lack roots, caring for air plants is much different than caring for other types of plants. They need lots of air to flow around them to avoid rotting, and they grow best in bright, indirect light. Instead of watering the plants at their base, gardeners suggest weekly misting the leaves or immersing the entire top part of the plant in water for about an hour, then removing extra water by gently shaking the plant. Relatively easy to care for, air plants are interesting and versatile.

According to the passage, air plants use structures that resemble roots primarily to

The food of the elephant is so abundant, that in feeding he never appears to be impatient or voracious, but rather to play with the leaves and branches on which he leisurely feeds. In riding by places where a herd has recently halted, I have sometimes seen the bark peeled curiously off the twigs, as though it had been done in mere dalliance. In the same way in eating grass the elephant selects a tussock which he draws from the ground by a dexterous twist of his trunk, and nothing can be more graceful than the ease with which, before conveying it to his mouth, he beats the earth from its roots by striking it gently upon his foreleg. A coconut he first rolls under foot, to detach the strong outer bark, then stripping off with his trunk the thick layer of fiber within, he places the shell in his mouth, and swallows with evident relish the fresh liquid which flows as he crushes it between his grinders.

Louis Daguerre was a French artist, physicist, and inventor who painted sets for the opera and developed large scale dioramas--three-dimensional depictions of a scene using multiple paintings, objects, and light. However, Daguerre is most famous for inventing one of the earliest forms of the modern photograph, which was revealed to the public in 1839. To produce his photographic images, Daguerre used smooth, silver-coated copper plates that were treated with iodine to make them light sensitive and then developed using mercury vapor. Although the process took about thirty minutes, the result was a captured image of an object. Initially, Daguerre was only able to produce images of stationary, bright white objects, such as shells, fossils, and plaster casts of sculptures because they reflected the most light. Nevertheless, he worked hard to improve his invention, and he was able to photograph moving objects using a faster process within a year. Daguerre named his forerunner of the modern printed snapshot the daguerreotype.

During the summertime, temperatures can reach 110 degrees Fahrenheit, even in the shade, so land developers in the early 1900s got creative. They built the town’s living quarters underground in buildings called dugouts. Underground, the temperature hovers around a comfortable 75 degrees Fahrenheit, year round. This solution was so effective that half of the population now lives below the land’s surface, where residents can still access everything from art galleries to museums to luxury hotels. Of course, with its unique buildings and opal mines, Coober Pedy relies, in part, on tourism for economic revenue. For travelers interested in trying their hand at mining, it is possible to search for opals, or “noodle,” on Coober Pedy’s public land.

Next, buy or make a thick, sugar-based paste called fondant, using food coloring to achieve the desired color and mixing well for even color. Once the fondant is just the right shade, roll it out onto a non-stick surface, such as wax paper. Dip the shape cutter into powdered sugar to prevent sticking, and then press it into the thin fondant layer. Gently remove the fondant letter by tapping on the edge of the cutter. If it doesn’t fall out, try using your fingers to scrape any excess fondant away from the cutter to make it easier to remove the letter. If that method fails, you can always use a toothpick to help get it out. For best results, let the letters dry for one or two days until they become hard, and then use icing to stick them to your cake.

According to the passage, what should be done immediately before pressing the cutter into the fondant?

Soon after, Blodgett found employment with a major American corporation, where she was encouraged by a mentor to continue her education. In 1926, she became the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in physics from Cambridge University. Armed with her doctorate, she returned to her former employer, and it was while working there that Blodgett invented “invisible glass”--thin, non-reflective coatings that could be applied to glass surfaces such as eyeglasses and camera lenses. Furthermore, during World War II, Blodgett improved on a method for creating “smoke screens” that saved the lives of many soldiers by reducing their inhalation of toxic smoke. Though she died in 1979, Blodgett is still celebrated for her many contributions to science and society.

It would be tedious to write out a bare list only of the numerous libraries and bibliographical treasures which, in one way or another, have been seized by the Fire-king as his own. Chance conflagrations, fanatic incendiarism, judicial bonfires, and even household stoves have, time after time, thinned the treasures as well as the rubbish of past ages, until, probably, not one thousandth part of the books that have been are still extant. This destruction cannot, however, be reckoned as all loss; for had not the ""cleansing fires"" removed mountains of rubbish from our midst, strong destructive measures would have become a necessity from sheer want of space in which to store so many volumes.

Five kilometers is just a little over three miles, and running this distance is a great activity for people who are looking to become more physically active. In a 5K race, people run or walk individually or as a group, often having trained for months before race day. Free online training resources for a 5K are available, and programs typically suggest a combination of walking, running, and resting. Many programs recommend walking at first, advising beginners to work up to maintaining a faster pace over longer distances. Rest days help reduce risks of injury or becoming too tired. Wearing comfortable clothes and supportive shoes while training, and exercising at a speed that allows for conversation in order to avoid overexertion are other common guidelines. Of course, all athletes should drink plenty of water, eat a healthy diet, and apply generous amounts of sunscreen while outside. By starting small, athletes can steadily improve their abilities while remaining injury-free.

Studies have shown that some health concerns, including a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, are associated with prolonged sitting. Though an evidenced-based recommendation has not yet been made for how long is too long to remain seated, experts suggest interrupting sitting periods by standing whenever possible. This may involve using a standing desk, setting an alarm as a reminder to take a stand-and-stretch break, or simply taking occasional walking breaks. Such intermittent movement activates the breakdown of fats and sugars, whereas sitting impedes this process. Practicing a more active lifestyle may also lead to better health through weight loss and increased energy levels, although exercising for several hours a week will not be adequate to entirely counteract the negative effects of long bouts of uninterrupted sitting. Although it is sometimes easier and more comfortable to remain sedentary, minimizing the amount of time spent sitting will likely lead to better health.

The grape bunches are either picked and laid out to dry on paper trays or dried directly on the vines for a few weeks. Next, these dried grapes are shipped to a processing plant where samples of the dried fruit bunches are initially inspected to ensure that the raisins meet certain government standards. After that, dirt or any other extraneous material is removed from the fruit. One of the final stages of processing involves separating the raisins from the stems. For this step, special machines are used to shake the fruit clusters and then remove the remaining pieces of stem from individual raisins. Lastly, the raisins are sorted by size and packaged for distribution to retailers.

Although only a small amount of material is in each matchstick, the process of making them involves multiple steps. First, tree logs are debarked and peeled into thin sheets called veneers. The sheets of veneer are placed in a chopper that can produce as many as one thousand match splints, or thin slivers of wood, in a single stroke. The splints are then soaked in an ammonium phosphate solution, a fire retardant that helps ensure a matchstick won’t continue to burn after the flame has been extinguished. After the matchsticks dry, they are immersed in molten paraffin wax, a petroleum-based substance that provides even burning. Next are the match heads, which are formed by dipping one end of the sticks into trays of a chemical solution that will help the match ignite when struck.

The impressionist painting style is often characterized by its dabs of unblended colors that artists loosely brush onto canvases to depict changes in light. For years, people reacted to this movement with ridicule and confusion, claiming that these paintings seem more like unfinished sketches or “impressions” than respectable works of art. However, an art dealer named Paul Durand-Ruel saw enough genius in impressionist works to dedicate years of his life to arguing the artistic merits of this movement. Durand-Ruel sponsored unpopular exhibitions for over two decades until, finally, he was triumphant. After years of public censure, Durand-Ruel organized an exhibition of over 300 impressionist works of art at a gallery in London.

This machine was designed to break down dried corn kernels by flaking and cooking them, thereby producing more digestible food for the animals. Moistened corn kernels were also sprinkled into the dry mixture to prevent the machine from clogging. The continuously running machine was hot enough to bake the moistened corn into long, puffy ribbons. The puffed-up corn strips might have remained unnoticed had it not been for Wilson, who decided to take them home to eat as a snack.

2088.	The following excerpt is from Love of the Wild by Archie P. McKishnie (1910).

Winter had swept down almost without warning, gripping the waters in its clutch and breathing into the very marrow of the trees, numbing them to drowsy forgetfulness. They stood in the blue-cold winter morning with still arms uplifted toward the chill skies, great, silent, un-protesting. And with each shortening day the frost bit deeper and their sleep became heavier. Sometimes a dream of golden summer came to bestir the soul of giant beech or tall maple, and its heart, waking to life, would shiver its icy manacles with a mighty crash, only to leave it wounded and shivering, a maimed thing into which spring would breathe her healing balm after a little while.

As I gazed for one brief moment upwards during a lull in the storm, my eyes were almost blinded by a brilliant light, brighter than the flame from an incandescent lamp, and a thousand times as large, which seemed to shoot from out of space. At the same awful moment the very dome of heaven seemed cracked asunder by a loud report, different from anything I had ever heard before. It was a solid and metallic sound, louder and sharper than the report of tons of exploding nitroglycerine. The earth shook and trembled to its utmost foundations, and the rocks seemed to recoil at the frightful explosion.

I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-door, and went in.

Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bison which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds.

The night was not very dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort of twilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passersby come and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed it again immediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb.

Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness--a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.

When Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully. The whitewashed walls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache over their own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round braided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before. In one corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark, low-turned posts. In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner table adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight mirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white muslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which sent a shiver to the very marrow of Anne’s bones.

In the sunlight--in the daytime, when Nature is alive and busy all around us, we like the open hill-sides and the deep woods well enough: but in the night, when our Mother Earth has gone to sleep, and left us waking, oh! the world seems so lonesome, and we get frightened, like children in a silent house. Then we sit and sob, and long for the gas-lit streets, and the sound of human voices, and the answering throb of human life. We feel so helpless and so little in the great stillness, when the dark trees rustle in the night-wind. There are so many ghosts about, and their silent sighs make us feel so sad. Let us gather together in the great cities, and light huge bonfires of a million gas-jets, and shout and sing together, and feel brave.

He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing color sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.

It was carelessly at first, like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward, and to whom external matters are of little value and import, unless they bear relation to something within his mind. Very soon, however, his look became keen and penetrative. A writhing horror twisted itself across his features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making one little pause, with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight. His face darkened with some powerful emotion, which, nevertheless, he so instantaneously controlled by an effort of his will, that, save at a single moment, its expression might have passed for calmness. After a brief space, the convulsion grew almost imperceptible, and finally subsided into the depths of his nature.

He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, somber and terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures. He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea; doubtless these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry. Dantes dived again, and remained a long time beneath the water.

The ruins of a caravansary, or guesthouse for desert travelers, dating back to the third century BC have been found in Syria. Ancient guidebooks document travel a few centuries later by wealthy scholars from Rome, who stopped at inns on the way to see the wonders of Egypt. During the Middle Ages in Europe, some travelers relied on monasteries and abbeys for shelter. The early hotel industry can be said to have formed during the fifteenth century. At that time, France began to require inn proprietors to maintain a register of guests, and the English government began regulating lodging establishments. Fast forward to the 1950s, when air travel became available to the masses, and we find the hotel industry booming to keep up with demand. By the end of the twentieth century, hotels near airports also featured conference spaces.

The five Great Lakes--Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior--were formed 16,000 to 20,000 years ago when Earth’s climate warmed, causing the last glacial continental ice sheet to retreat from North America. As it retreated, the icy glacier was so heavy, and its momentum so powerful, that it carved out land, creating several lake basins. Water from the melting glacier filled the five basins that would later become the Great Lakes. But it was not until approximately 3,500 to 4,000 years ago that these geographical marvels reached their modern dimensions and water levels. Today, the Great Lakes region supports agriculture, fishing, and tourism, and generates millions of jobs in the Midwest.

As a result, the U.S. government urged its citizens to plant “victory gardens” and harvest produce for personal use. Nearly twenty million Americans found the time and space to plant their own gardens. Popular magazines even printed stories about victory gardens that provided instructions on how to grow and preserve fresh fruits and vegetables rather than use canned food, in order to save commercially-produced food products for the troops overseas. By 1944, American gardeners had harvested about eight million tons of produce in their homegrown effort to support the war.

Capsaicinoids are odorless, tasteless chemical compounds naturally produced in the white, fleshy membranes where the seeds attach to the inside of the pepper pod. Although they are not the source of the pepper’s heat--which is really a pain signal rather than a flavor--pepper seeds acquire some heat through physical contact with the membrane. So, if you want the flavor of peppers in your dishes, but want to reduce the intensity of their spiciness, carefully remove both the peppers’ seeds and the white flesh that holds them in place. But if you like your food on the spicy side, you might want to leave part of the pepper membrane intact when you are preparing your meals.

If I were asked to describe as briefly and popularly as I could, what a university was, I should draw my answer from its ancient designation of a Studium Generale, or “School of Universal Learning.” This description implies the assemblage of strangers from all parts in one spot;--from all parts; else, how will you find professors and students for every department of knowledge? And in one spot; else, how can there be any school at all? Accordingly, in its simple and rudimental form, it is a school of knowledge of every kind, consisting of teachers and learners from every quarter. Many things are requisite to complete and satisfy the idea embodied in this description; but such as this a university seems to be in its essence, a place for the communication and circulation of thought, by means of personal [interaction], through a wide extent of country.

Many architects unused to color problems design their ornament with very little thought about the colors which they propose to employ, making it an after-consideration; but the two things should be considered synchronously for the best final effect. There is a cryptic saying that “color is at right angles to form,” that is, color is capable of making surfaces advance toward or recede from the eye, just as modelling does; and for this reason, if color is used, a great deal of modelling may be dispensed with. If a receding color is used on a recessed plane, it deepens that plane unduly; while on the other hand if a color which refuses to recede—like yellow for example—is used where depth is wanted, the receding plane and the approaching color neutralize one another, resulting in an effect of flatness not intended.

Based on the passage, the view of the narrator is that architects

A.	should use either color or modelling but not both.
B.	tend to use receding and advancing colors equally.

From a culinary perspective, however, barbecue is a cooking method that entails cooking meat over an indirect flame or open fire. The origins of the word barbecue are unclear; some say that Spanish explorers borrowed the method and name (barbacoa) from the indigenous people of the West Indies. In any case, I’ve learned that across America there are distinct barbecue styles, named after their place of origin. For instance, Memphis-style pulled pork barbecue is characterized by its sweet, tomato-based sauce, whereas Kansas City barbecue involves cooking pork ribs with a dry rub. North Carolinians prefer their pork with a vinegar-based sauce that, depending on the region, may or may not include tomato. Seasonings aside, Texas grill masters are known for cuts of beef rather than pork for their barbecue. Just about any style of barbecue cooking transforms ordinary ingredients into savory meals.

Though it’s not always easy for parents or caregivers to find the time and energy to read to young children, research shows that reading to children from infancy and beyond stimulates brain development. Parents who read, talk, and sing to their children may notice that their young ones develop larger vocabularies than other children who hear fewer words in their conversations with adults. In fact, studies show that reading age-appropriate books aloud to young children and talking about the illustrations and words strengthens language skills, literacy development, and parent-child relationships. So, help the young children in your life develop more expansive vocabularies, and settle down to a page-turner that both you and the child will find interesting and engaging.

Though kangaroos and koalas are quite popular marsupials, bilbies--a type of bandicoot--are equally intriguing. A bilby can measure up to twenty-one inches in length, has a long, thin tongue, and looks something like a cross between a rat--due to its long, skinny tail--and a rabbit--due to its large pointed ears. Bilbies are talented diggers, and they create multiple burrows throughout their territory to use for shelter. Interestingly, bilbies do not need to drink water because they get what little moisture they require from their diet. Unlike kangaroos--but similar to koalas and another Australian marsupial, wombats--female bilbies have pouches with openings facing backward, so burrowing behavior does not fill the pouch with dirt. Although bilby populations were widespread across much of the Australian continent one hundred years ago, they are now limited to a few fragmented areas.

Over 400 hundred years ago, the Konso people built communities atop dry, rocky hills and fortified them with stone walls for defensive purposes. Surrounding each Konso town is between one and six of these protective walls, and within the walls are thatch-roofed huts and walking paths that lead to moras, or social gathering places. In addition to the stone walls, terraces formed by basalt blocks and soil, which follow the contours of the rocky hills, are one of the most noticeable features of the Konso landscape. The terraces reduce soil erosion and retain appropriate amounts of water to support growing crops. These extraordinary hilltop villages are built entirely out of natural materials and continue to be occupied and maintained by the Konso people today.

Shortly thereafter, an archaeologist named I.M. Dzhafarzade organized expeditions to inventory the images, and since then over 6,000 rock engravings have been discovered that illustrate over 40,000 years of history. The petroglyphs feature numerous depictions of ancient life, such as boats, hunters armed with spears, and dance scenes. The art also shows plant and wildlife species that existed thousands of years ago at a time when the climate at this location was warmer and received more rainfall. Though only six fish images have been found, there is an image that many believe represents a dolphin, which is an extinct species in this semi-desert area today.

A quipu was formed by hanging many strings vertically from a main horizontal wooden bar or string. Using different colored strings, a variety of knots, and knot positions spaced along the strings, specially trained people recorded information such as census data, inventories, dates, and taxes owed. For instance, numbers recorded on a brown string might represent counts of alpacas, and those on a yellow string might represent amounts of corn. A certain type of knot represented the number one, and a knot with loops represented the numbers two through nine. A simple knot represented a power of ten--10, 100, 1,000, etc.--depending on its position along one vertical string. The specially trained people were responsible not only for recording information using quipus, but for providing an accurate oral interpretation that would fully explain the information encoded in each quipu.

A government assembly, first held in the year 930, was called the Althing and was conducted for two weeks each summer at the same site, a hospitable area for a large gathering. During the Althing, a council of chieftains from communities far and wide reviewed and publicly voted on the laws. Additionally, every ninth farmer--the majority of the settlers at that time were farmers--was required to attend the Althing. In this way, the laws governing the people of Iceland were passed in an open-air forum and influenced by many citizens. The event also attracted other people from all parts of Iceland, including vendors, entertainers, and tradesmen. The Althing tradition ended in 1798; however, the site remains an essential part of Iceland’s national identity.

This chariot, later named the Monteleone chariot, features elaborate designs illustrating the life of Achilles, the mythological Greek war hero. Experts believe that the Monteleone chariot was a parade chariot and was therefore reserved for use during special ceremonies. Furthermore, historians speculate that several types of craftspersons were involved in building the chariot, including carpenters as well as bronze, ivory, and leather workers. The quality of the construction and ornamentation of this ancient chariot reflects the exemplary skills of these ancient artisans. The Monteleone chariot was carefully restored and is on display for the enjoyment of visitors and scholars alike.

The large, low-set ears of sand cats allow them to hear desert prey both above and below the ground, as well as the mating calls of distant sand cats. With dense coats shaded pale brown and light grey, these creatures easily blend in with their desert surroundings. The thickness of the sand cat’s coat provides insulation from the climate’s extreme temperatures; even their paws are covered with fur, allowing them to move lightly over the sand, barely leaving footprints. Unlike housecats, sand cats are competent diggers who create and live in burrows. At night when it is cooler, these nocturnal animals maintain a post outside of their burrows before leaving to hunt. They often travel long distances before returning to their burrows at daybreak, where they stand watch again before retreating underground during the heat of the day.

The passage suggests that sand cats

A.	would be suitable housecats for people in hot climates.
B.	are particularly well-adapted to their environment.

Centuries ago, the people of the Netherlands, the Dutch, began to engineer solutions to protect their lands from fluctuating water levels. An early process entailed mounding up earth to form raised hills and building settlements on top of them. Later, walls or dikes were constructed between the hills to help control where the water could flow, and the tops of the dikes also served as paths between villages. Beginning in the 1100s, the Dutch began draining waterlogged marsh zones and enclosed low areas, called polders, in order to expand the areas available for settlement and agriculture. Windmills were built to power pumps, capable of pushing vast quantities of water out of a region and into a river, canal, or lake. New efforts to conserve or reclaim land from the sea continue even today.

For example, creating a sleep schedule, even on the weekends, is important. By going to bed at the same time each night, we let our bodies know what to expect and can consistently get the amount of sleep we need. People should also create a comfortable sleeping environment, and try to limit exposure to light before winding down at the end of the day. Napping or eating close to bedtime can also interfere with good sleep, and people should cut out beverages containing caffeine and alcohol. If you have trouble getting a good night’s sleep, try one or more of these suggestions. You may sleep easier tonight.

In fact, when we believe we are multitasking, we are probably just switching quickly between individual tasks. Managing certain tasks at the same time is nearly impossible due to what scientists call interference. Interference is when similar tasks using the same part of the brain have to compete with each other. Tasks such as writing a message and talking to someone have high interference because both of these tasks rely on the brain’s ability to process language, making it almost impossible to complete these tasks simultaneously. However, the human brain can prioritize certain information to help us complete a single task. For example, if we are trying to understand something on the phone, our brains might focus more on auditory input and less on visual input, which allows us to ignore distractions. Interestingly, studies show that people who frequently multitask are more likely to notice distractions and have increased difficulty filtering out irrelevant information.

Which of the following statements best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	True multitasking is rarely possible.
B.	Frequent multitasking can lead to more distractions.
C.	Filtering irrelevant auditory or visual input is very challenging.

Although some people refer to the bone deposits on a male deer’s head as horns, they are called antlers and are complex structures made of blood vessels, nerves, and skin, in addition to cartilage and bone. Young male deer grow their first set of antlers when they are about a year old. Regulation of the level of certain hormones in deer, mainly testosterone, is believed to be fundamental to antler growth. In male deer, annual antler growth begins during the spring, just after the prior year’s antlers have been shed and when testosterone levels are low. Early in summer, most deer antlers are soft and almost squishy, and they grow rapidly. Late in the summer, antlers calcify and harden. Typically from December through March, the deer will begin to shed their antlers. As deer grow older, their antlers usually grow back larger every year.

Ancient goldsmiths inlaid small pieces of semi-precious stones into gold ornaments by cutting the stones precisely to fit into spaces created by ribs of metal fused to a gold base. This method eventually spread to other parts of the world where it was further developed, most notably in China, France, and Russia. Most modern cloisonne is now made by filling partitions with powdered enamel, rather than with natural stones, and then heating the entire piece to melt the enamel. The heating process may be repeated several times to ensure that the enamel fills each partition entirely. Once the artist is satisfied, the surface of the finished piece is polished to create a brilliant, smooth surface. Many cloisonne-inspired works have survived centuries of handling and use, and some of the best examples are on display at museums throughout the world.

Spotting a meteor shower is like witnessing a display of natural fireworks; but when referring to this event, it is worth noting the distinctions between meteors, meteoroids, meteorites, and asteroids. Meteoroids are small bodies in space that consist of rocky or metallic debris. They are simply smaller versions of asteroids. An event known as a meteor or shooting star happens when a meteoroid passes through Earth’s atmosphere. The resulting friction heats the debris and causes it to glow until it burns up, creating a streak of light across the sky. If part of a meteoroid manages to land on Earth’s surface without vaporizing, it is called a meteorite. Although meteors can occur at any time, we are more likely to see a shower of them when Earth passes through the tail of a comet. This is because the trailing particles of a comet’s tail provide a magnificent display of light as they enter our atmosphere.

According to the passage, a meteor is distinct from a meteoroid because a meteor

A.	is caused by burning debris.

It is the largest complete colossal squid ever seen, and, while almost every part of this specimen is intriguing, its eyes are of particular interest. Each eye is about the size of a soccer ball, making them the largest animal eyes ever studied. Unlike its giant squid relative, whose eyes are on either side of its head, the eyes of the colossal squid face forward, giving it binocular vision and enabling it to gauge distance. Not only are the preserved squid’s eyeballs large, but its pupils are as well. This means it could collect as much light as possible far below the surface of the sea. Additionally, like all colossal squids, each of the preserved squid’s eyes are equipped with a light organ called a photophore. Through a chemical reaction, photophores produce light that helps illuminate the depths of the Southern Ocean where these squid live, thus helping them spot and capture prey.

According to the passage, the pupils of a colossal squid

One of the earliest writing materials was made out of papyrus, a plant indigenous to Egypt. Reeds of papyrus were intertwined, pounded until they were quite thin, and later dried. Papyrus, which shares its name with the plant, resembled more of a mat than a sheet of paper and was often used for scrolls rather than books. Another early writing surface, called parchment, was made from animal hides and was popular in Europe for hundreds of years. Unlike papyrus, parchment could be easily trimmed and used as material for books. Paper as we know it today originated in ancient China, and was possibly used as early as the second century AD.

Cardamom, one of the most expensive spices in the world along with saffron and vanilla, is referred to by many as the “queen of spices.” Dried cardamom seeds are ground or left whole to lend their distinctive taste to food. Alternatively, the seeds can be used for their fragrant oil, which is blended with other essential oils to create perfumes. Cardamom is prized for its warm, spicy aroma and a taste profile that is a combination of ginger and lemon rind or grapefruit. People use cardamom to flavor everything from beverages, such as black tea and mulled cider, to meat dishes featuring chicken and lamb. Cardamom’s aroma is due in part to a chemical compound called eucalyptol, which is also found in bay leaves.

While some consider it a vegetable in the culinary sense because it is not sweet like other fruits, the avocado meets the scientific criteria of a berry. To begin with, an avocado is classified as a fruit because it is the matured ovary of a flower. Next, it is a fleshy fruit because--below the outer skin--the plump middle layer of the ovary wall comprises the bulk of the fruit. Some people realize the avocado is a fruit, but they believe it is a “stone fruit” because of its single large seed. However, stone fruits, like peaches, are characterized by a tough or bony seed covering. The thin inner brown layer that directly covers the avocado seed is instead soft, not leathery, and this is what makes it a berry.

Sonar uses sound waves to locate and identify objects by interpreting the echoes that bounce off them. While animals such as bats and dolphins use this technique naturally when they engage in echolocation, people began harnessing sonar during the early 1900s and then were spurred to further develop and apply the technology during World War I and II. There are two modes of sonar used for tracking and locating objects: active and passive. Passive sonar is primarily used by the military as a wartime tool that enables detection of sounds without emitting a signal. In contrast, active sonar involves emitting sound pulses called pings in order to receive returning echoes, which allows users to detect objects that are twice as far away but gives up the anonymity of the sender.

Another study suggests dog owners are less likely to report feeling lonely and anxious, because petting a dog can elevate levels of chemicals in the brain that are known to promote relaxation. In addition to these incentives, dog ownership also encourages socializing, as dog owners often form relationships around interactions they have with other dog owners at dog parks, during hikes with their pets, or at dog training classes.

My east window looked across the Halifax River to the peninsula woods. Beyond them was the ocean. Immediately after breakfast, therefore, I made toward the north bridge, and in half an hour or less was on the beach. Beaches are much the same the world over, and there is no need to describe this one--Silver Beach, I think I heard it called--except to say that it is broad, hard, and, for a pleasure-seeker’s purpose, endless. It is backed by low sand-hills covered with impenetrable scrub,--oak and palmetto,--beyond which is a dense growth of short-leaved pines. Perfect weather, a perfect beach, and no throng of people: here were the conditions of happiness; and here for eight days I found it. The ocean itself was a solitude. Day after day not a sail was in sight. Looking up and down the beach, I could usually see somewhere in the distance a carriage or two, and as many foot passengers; but I often walked a mile, or sat for half an hour, without being within hail of any one.

According to the passage, Silver Beach is backed by

A.	a flowing river.

One theory was that carbon dioxide released by bacteria living in the cheese created the holes. To try to account for the variation in the number, size, and distribution of holes, another theory claimed that the holes formed around some type of particle. In more recent years, scientists in Switzerland used a computerized scanner to examine ripening cheese at a microscopic level. Their research found that carbon dioxide trapped in the cheese does indeed collect around foreign objects such as microscopic hay particles, resulting in cheese holes. Based on these findings, the occurrence of Swiss cheese holes should differ depending on how hygienic the cheese processing conditions are.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	Sterile cheese production processes may produce fewer cheese holes.
B.	Scientists can use scanner technology to regulate bacteria in cheese.
C.	Carbon dioxide can be added to ripened cheese to create holes.

With the approach of evening all is changed. A mountain will suddenly intercept the sun; a shadow fall upon the valley; in ten minutes the thermometer will drop as many degrees; the peaks that are no longer shone upon dwindle into ghosts; and meanwhile, overhead, if the weather be rightly characteristic of the place, the sky fades towards night through a surprising key of colors. The latest gold leaps from the last mountain. Soon, perhaps, the moon shall rise, and in her gentler light the valley shall be mellowed and misted, and here and there a wisp of silver cloud upon a hilltop, and here and there a warmly glowing window in a house, between fire and starlight, kind and homely in the fields of snow.

For a time I wrote literary screeds for the Golden Era. C. H. Webb had established a very excellent literary weekly called the Californian, but high merit was no guaranty of success; it languished, and he sold out to three printers, and Bret Harte became editor at $20 a week, and I was employed to contribute an article a week at $12. But the journal still languished, and the printers sold out to Captain Ogden, a rich man and a pleasant gentleman who chose to amuse himself with such an expensive luxury without much caring about the cost of it. When he grew tired of the novelty, he re-sold to the printers, the paper presently died a peaceful death, and I was out of work again.

On average, LED bulbs are more energy-efficient and last longer than other modern light sources, including halogen and compact-fluorescent bulbs. While they tend to be more expensive than other lighting options, LED products typically emit less heat than incandescent bulbs, which is a major reason why many retailers around the world have retired old-fashioned bulbs and lamps in favor of LEDs. In fact, incandescent light bulbs of certain wattages are no longer produced in the United States per government energy efficiency standards passed by Congress. So, while they may cost you a little more up front, be thankful you can reap the benefits of LED bulbs. You won’t be replacing them very often, and you will save energy in the long run.

The author of the passage is most likely trying to

A.	clarify legislation enforcing the use of energy-efficient light bulbs.

Essentially, neo-impressionists took a methodical approach to painting that relied on the prevailing scientific ideas of optics and color theory. In his work, Seurat used divisionism, or the practice of painting separate, individual touches of different pure colors near each other in such a way that they blended together when viewed from a short distance. Seurat developed the pointillism technique of applying tiny, uniformly sized dots to achieve this effect. Unlike impressionists who gravitated toward realistic scenes capturing movement, neo-impressionists favored carefully composed forms. Seurat believed that small distinct touches of contrasting or complementary colors created tones that were much more intense than colors created by pre-mixing pigments or blending different hues directly on the canvas.

Based on the passage, Seurat launched a painting technique that involved

A.	defining forms with dotted outlines.
B.	applying paint in a precise manner.

While there are many different theories as to why zebras have stripes, there is one thing that experts are certain about: each zebra’s stripes are as unique to them as a fingerprint is to people. For this reason, some scientists believe zebras recognize each other by their stripe patterns. Additionally, zebras’ stripes may provide protection by making it difficult for predators to single out one zebra from the rest of the herd and may confuse disease-carrying insects that are used to seeing large areas of monochromatic fur. Thermoregulation, or the control of body temperature, has also been linked to the stripe patterns of zebras. Zebras living in warmer environments typically display bolder stripes, whereas zebras native to colder climates frequently have fewer stripes that are thinner and lighter in color.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Zebras with thinner stripes tend to blend in better with the herd.
B.	Stripes are more prominent on zebras that live in colder climates.
C.	Individual zebras can be identified by their distinctive stripe patterns.

The Pension Building, as it was originally called, was completed in 1887 and was constructed mostly from brick, for affordability and resistance to fire. The structure was built to provide office space for the U.S. Pension Bureau and to house pension records; therefore, it was essential that the building be fireproof. The structure was also required to host important social and political events, and for this reason it was designed with a striking central interior feature: the Great Hall. The Corinthian-style columns in the large, open space support the roof structure and are said to be among the world’s tallest. In addition to its aesthetic appeal, the Great Hall allows sunlight to illuminate the surrounding offices, and a clever arrangement of vents and windows makes this space a repository for fresh air. Practical and ingenious, the Great Hall is one of the museum’s most popular attractions.

Using his new long-range lenses, he photographed several cheetahs, numerous elands, and a large herd of wildebeests grazing by the river. Luisa, his boss, will be thrilled with these photos, Sandy thought. Unstrapping his aviator goggles, he noted the sun’s position and determined that he could fly another hour before he needed to land and make camp for the night. When his boss first informed him of this assignment, Sandy considered it something to be endured, a punishment for being smarter than Luisa’s son Ned but not smart enough to hide it.

Beyond, in long lines, kept in order by the native police, were the carriages and motor-cars of the Honolulu aristocracy. On the wharf the Royal Hawaiian Band played “Aloha Oe,” and when it finished, a stringed orchestra of native musicians on board the transport took up the same sobbing strains, the native woman singer’s voice rising birdlike above the instruments and the hubbub of departure.

When the rack falls to the floor, I fear that he may have hurt himself, but he’s always fine. Then, it is time for his walk—two laps around the block—followed by a hardy breakfast and another trip outside for a game of fetch. He plays with the same three toys, one at a time, and paces back and forth from the kitchen to the living room before each meal, another peculiarity of his. All his meals must be prepared exactly the same way: equal parts chicken and bacon-flavored kibble mixed with a half cup of canned black beans and organic baby carrot shavings.

Much of the eighteenth-century etiquette that the young Washington transcribed is still commonplace today. For example, it is still considered polite to cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze, or yawn; to not chew your nails; and to avoid falling asleep when someone else is speaking. Other rules, however, such as not crossing your ankles when sitting down, and not eating in the streets or the house out of season, have become more or less obsolete over time. Washington also wrote out rules that advised him to keep his nails clean and short, accept criticism thankfully, refrain from gossiping, and avoid cleaning his teeth with his napkin. With advanced technology, modern life has the added complexities of learning to be properly considerate of others in a digital world, where cryptic text messages and social media sites pose new etiquette challenges.

As a form of defense, a tree exudes a sticky resin when its bark is damaged. Insects and plant matter can sometimes become entombed within the resin. Most resins will decay over time, but if a chemically stable type of resin is buried in sediment and fossilizes, it becomes amber. Treasured for thousands of years, amber was among the first materials to be used by humans as ornamentation. Tracking down the geographical source of amber found in some figurines, buttons, and other artifacts helps archeologists obtain evidence of ancient trade routes. Amber that contains clearly visible insects and plant matter is especially prized. Not just interesting to look at, the flora and fauna found in amber have aided scientific research in the identification of extinct species. As in the past, amber is used today in jewelry as well as to produce varnish and incense.

Principally, the movement rejected antiquated worldviews as well as certain social and political orders, and it embraced modern thought and objective reasoning. Proponents of the Enlightenment argued that authoritative systems were preventing the discovery of truth, and, as an alternative, advocated using reason to better understand reality. The Enlightenment argued that the ability to reason renders people equal and deserving of the same treatment.

To build this type of model, first select a boat design and a glass bottle. Then, carve the hull, or body, from a block of wood, making sure the hull will fit through the bottle’s neck. Hollow out the hull and drill a small, shallow hole to accommodate the mast, the vertical pole to hold the sail. Construct and assemble the mast, sail, and boom, the horizontal pole to hold the sail. Then, cut the bottom end of the mast at an angle to allow it to tilt. Next, insert the mast into the hole and tie a long piece of thread to the top of the mast. Finally, collapse the mast toward the rear end of the boat and guide the boat into the bottle, rear-end first, while keeping the trailing end of the long thread outside the bottle. Once the boat is secured, slowly raise the mast by pulling gently on the thread. Tie-off and trim the thread, and the ship in a bottle is ready for display.

The invention of the carbon microphone, a device that relied on a carbon part to help transmit audio signals, led to competition among four inventors: Emile Berliner, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and David Edward Hughes. In 1877, Berliner filed a patent for his carbon microphone. Shortly thereafter Bell, who had invented a different type of microphone, bought Berliner’s patent rights for $50,000. However, Edison had also filed a patent for a carbon microphone in 1877, which led to a legal battle between Berliner and Edison. Though the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the device was Edison’s invention, Edison learned that Hughes was taking credit for a similar invention in Europe. Edison, believing Hughes had obtained secret information about Edison’s experiments, brought claims of plagiarism to the press. In reality, Hughes had documentation supporting the independence of his work predating Edison’s. The carbon microphone story is an excellent example of disputes that arise over the priority of a discovery in science and technology.

He stood gazing and gazing at it. The New World! The wonderful new world of which he had heard so much! And now he was really looking at it with his very living eyes. Virginia! That, then, was the New World. He stood gazing and gazing. In the long line of the horizon there was an open space free of trees. He wondered whether that was a tobacco-plantation. There was a single tree standing by itself--a straight, thin trunk, and a spread of foliage at the top. He wondered if it was a palm-tree.

We would prune off by degrees all unnecessary appendages, as unsounded or italic letters, and write out words so as to be capable of a distinct pronunciation. But this change must be gradually effected. From the spelling adopted two centuries ago, a wonderful improvement has taken place. And we have not yet gone beyond the possibility of improvement.

For those with an eye to see and knowledge to interpret, a landscape with its trees or flowers or marshes may contain a host of hidden secrets of dramatic import. Unfolded before one may be found a spectacle of struggle and strife, quiet tragedies of the forest, the inexorable pressure of plants upon their neighbors, the woods upon the prairies or an apparently forlorn hope of some plant living in a hot desert or upon some icy mountain peak. And while these rather obvious things are happening how much more is hidden of the adjustments that leaves or flowers or roots or other organs of the plant are constantly making to the conditions about them. Upon the perfection of such adjustments to light, heat, or water, for instance, depends their very existence.

Early versions of blue jeans can be traced back hundreds of years to the dungarees worn by sailors, which were wide-legged, dark-blue pants that hid dirt. Much later, in 1870, a tailor named Jacob Davis realized that the work pants he was making for customers were not sturdy enough, so he strengthened the pants by adding copper rivets at the stress points. For help patenting his idea, Davis turned to his fabric supplier, San Francisco business owner Levi Strauss. In addition to selling thread, buttons, and canvas for tents and covered wagons, Strauss was also selling his own version of work pants at the time. The two became a team and began contracting with individual tailors to make the riveted denim-twill pants. Wide-scale production began when Strauss and Davis established a dedicated factory. From a work essential to a fashion statement, blue jeans are still wildly popular today.

According to the passage, copper rivets were first added to work pants after

A.	Strauss opened a fabric supply business in San Francisco.
B.	Davis acted on an idea for strengthening stress points.

Perhaps one of the simplest measures beekeepers can take to ensure a healthy hive is in the proper placement of the colony. First and foremost, a hive site should provide bees with abundant sources of pollen and nectar. Also essential is easy access to fresh water, which is necessary to help regulate the hive temperature; however, too much moisture in the hive itself can lead to disease. In addition, the hive should be located where air temperatures are warm throughout the year. Because bees can become irritable or difficult to handle without adequate sunshine, it is important to choose a site with access to sufficient sunlight in the winter but enough shade in the summer to prevent overheating. Lastly, beekeepers must locate their hive away from possible exposure to toxins and pesticides. A hive location that meets these criteria will likely result in a healthy and productive bee colony.

According to the passage, which of the following conditions can make bees irritable?

A.	lack of adequate sunshine 
B.	excess moisture in the hive
C.	insufficient pollen and nectar 
D.	exposure to toxins and pesticides

Some orchestra-goers may notice that the instruments in a symphony orchestra are usually tuned to the “A” note of the oboe--a long, pipe-shaped woodwind instrument--just before a major performance. This tradition has been in place since the late 1600s, when the modern orchestra first originated. Orchestras of that time consisted of mostly stringed instruments, and composers began to incorporate a pair of oboes to reinforce the sound of the first and second violins. Composers soon discovered that the oboe’s stable pitch was more audible and reliable than those of stringed instruments, and shortly after, they began relying on the oboe for tuning the rest of the orchestra. If a keyboard instrument such as a piano is part of the orchestra, the oboist matches the piano’s “A” note and then plays it loud enough for the other musicians to hear. While many contemporary orchestras now rely on electronic devices for the perfect “A,” the tradition is still observed, as the oboist is responsible for operating the device.

According to the passage, oboes were first introduced to symphony orchestras to

A.	lead the keyboard instruments.

On May 15, 1862, Lincoln established the United States Department of Agriculture. Lincoln appropriately referred to the department as “The People’s Department,” because about half of all Americans lived on farms at that time. The president appointed a man named Isaac Newton—not to be confused with the British scientist Sir Isaac Newton of prior centuries—as the commissioner of the newly developed department. Newton had many ambitious goals such as publishing more information on agriculture; introducing valuable plants and livestock to farming communities; answering agriculture-related questions from farmers; testing farm machinery; and analyzing soils, grains, and vegetables. While the responsibilities of this department have since expanded, it still achieves the early goals established by Newton and Lincoln.

According to the passage, one of Isaac Newton’s objectives as commissioner was to

A.	familiarize farmers with new plants and animals.

From the excavation of ancient Babylonian tombs, archeologists discovered that Babylonian men dyed their fingernails using kohl, and that various colors were used to indicate social status. In ancient China, members of the ruling class also used nail color to indicate status, but its use by commoners was strictly prohibited. Chinese elites used a mixture of egg whites, beeswax, gum Arabic, and flower petals to dye their nails to match the colors of the reigning dynasty. The practice of nail art also arose in other parts of the world, including India, northern Africa, and the Middle East. By the 1800s, Britain was practicing nail art by coating fingernails with simple red oil. During the 1920s, France developed a unique nail polish formula when a makeup artist adapted the enamel used for car paint for use on fingernails. Since then, nail polish has evolved to include numerous shades, eye-catching embellishments, and creative application techniques.

While grant writing can be a very complex practice, there are a few steps that novice grant writers can take to strengthen their applications. First, it is important that writers gather all available information--mission statement, abstract, annual reports, and endorsements--regarding the project for which funding is sought. Next, grant writers should identify several funding sources that support the goals of their specific project. It is important that grant writers carefully review each potential grantmaker’s guidelines and pay special attention to restrictions and funding limits before writing the grant application. Reviewing the guidelines is probably the most important step, because a granting organization can choose to reject any application that does not meet its requirements. Following these steps will greatly increase a grant writer’s chance of receiving funding.

Based on the passage, what should be done immediately after gathering information about the project?

A.	Find funding sources.
B.	Determine funding limits.

First, find a safe, level place that is away from traffic, pull off the road, and engage the parking brake. Leave a car with manual transmission in gear. Place a block or rock in front of and behind the tire diagonally opposite the flat one, to prevent the car from rolling. After retrieving the spare tire, jack, and lug wrench from the car, loosen the lug nuts with the wrench, but do not remove them all the way. Next, raise the car using the jack until the flat tire is off the ground, and finish removing the lug nuts completely. Firmly grasp the flat tire and pull it toward you to remove it, then carefully guide the spare tire onto the wheel studs and screw each of the lug nuts back on by hand. Then, use the wrench to tighten the lug nuts until they are snug, but do not tighten them all the way at this point. Lower the jack so that the car is safely on the ground, and finish the job by tightening the lug nuts completely with the wrench.

According to the passage, what should a person do just after loosening the lug nuts?

However, the manufacture of solar panels does impact the environment. The fabrication of a solar panel involves large amounts of electricity, water, metals, plastics, and some hazardous chemicals. Additionally, the retired product must be broken down into individual parts before proper recycling can occur, and some manufacturers have not yet implemented proper end-of-life recycling programs. Because safe decommissioning is crucial for environmental safety, researchers continue to strategize on effective ways to recycle the components of solar energy systems. Furthermore, industry guidelines are being established to reduce the chemicals used and greenhouse gases emitted during manufacturing.

In color the Tiger matches the foliage of his native jungles. When lying in grass or even upon the ground the dark markings and rufous fawn colors of his body blend almost perfectly with his surroundings, and it has often happened that his presence was only guessed by the thrashing of his nervous tail in the grass as he gathered for a leap. Grassy plains and swamps are his favorite abiding places, and he does not hesitate to swim from island to island in search of prey. Curiously, again, for a cat, the Tiger does not climb trees except when forced to do so by floods.

She was enchanted by this dry, arid climate, and she produced iconic works that marked her as one of history’s great Modernist painters. Formally trained at art school, O’Keeffe initially embarked on a career as a commercial artist before becoming an art teacher. However, her career changed course when a series of her abstract charcoal drawings were exhibited at a New York gallery in 1916. O’Keeffe’s nontraditional, abstract works demonstrated her mastery of line, shape, and tone. Within several years, the American public fully recognized her spectacular talent, evident in her oil paintings depicting flowers and skyscrapers, and came to revere her as a gifted painter.

In order to better contain the food, trenchers were made with thick crusts, often had a shallow impression in the middle, and were baked using coarse varieties of grains. Though their main purpose was to distinguish one person’s food from another’s and to perhaps keep the table relatively clean, by the end of the meal, the liquids absorbed by the trenchers made the bread softer and more flavorful. Hosts were said to have asked bakers for four-day-old trenchers for their dinner parties, for extra sturdiness. After the bread served its plate purpose, some people ate the trencher itself. Over time, wooden plates replaced trenchers on the dining table.

Based on the passage, trenchers were used at dinner parties to

As a young man during the early 1830s, Melville dropped out of school and worked a variety of jobs to help support his mother and siblings after the family’s New York import business collapsed. In 1839, Melville embarked on the first of many sea voyages. During his seagoing years, Melville’s adventures included living with Pacific Islanders, participating in a mutiny, and working on whaling ships. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1843 for one final sea journey before returning to Boston in 1844. There, Melville began to write and publish novels based on his time at sea. In 1847, he married Elizabeth Shaw, and continued to pursue his career as a writer. Because Melville’s works received more criticism than praise, he worked as a customs inspector to earn a steady paycheck, but he never completely gave up on his writing. It wasn’t until decades after his death that Melville’s literary works gained the attention and respect they engender today.

While Type II supernovas involve only one star, Type I supernovas involve two stars that orbit one another. In the event of a Type I supernova, one of the stars, typically a white dwarf, begins to absorb matter released from its companion star. This captured matter accumulates on the surface of the white dwarf, eventually causing it to become so massive that it reaches a point of instability. Once this point is reached, a nuclear chain reaction occurs, creating an immense explosion of the dwarf star that hurls chemical elements and debris out into space. Some of the elements may become new stars or be incorporated into other stars and planets far away.

Based on the passage, what happens immediately after a white dwarf becomes unstable in a Type I supernova?

A.	It experiences a nuclear chain reaction.

Although microscopes with multiple lenses already existed, van Leeuwenhoek simplified the design and created a much clearer, more precise instrument by using a single lens that he could focus finely with a pair of screws. Despite having no advanced technical education, van Leeuwenhoek was able to create microscopes that achieved magnifications of up to 270 times, about five times as powerful as other microscopes at that time. This enabled him to observe tiny single-celled organisms and other minute specimens such as blood cells and insect parts. Van Leeuwenhoek’s microscopes were only a few inches long and made of copper or silver. About a dozen of them are still in existence today.

When outdoor temperatures increase, animals use physiological and behavioral strategies to beat the heat. One of the most common strategies for cooling off is to decrease the insulation of the skin. For a bird, feathers are what retain heat, and so some birds will spread their wings in hot weather to allow air to circulate and dissipate heat, while others ruffle their feathers. Mammals with fur coats, such as most dogs, shed some of their fur. Another common way to cool off is simply to go somewhere cooler--maybe into a cave or under the water. Some creatures even burrow underground and stay there until the heat and dry weather become more bearable, occasionally months later. Some animals also release heat from their bodies by sweating, which acts like water splashed on the body, or by panting, which expels excess heat. Even certain birds, such as robins, pant to lower their internal temperature by opening their beaks.

A.	Birds and mammals use similar behaviors to cool off.

The original cookie may have been cylinder-shaped, with preserved fruit wrapped in dough and then rolled in sugar. The variations created in Latin America, however, use different ingredients and have come to take a different shape. The common Latin American version involves two round flat cookies sandwiched with filling in the middle and then dipped in a sweet coating. For example, the very popular form of alfajores from Argentina uses buttery shortbread for the cookies and dulce de leche, a form of caramel made by boiling condensed milk, for the filling. Then the cookie sandwich is dipped in chocolate or coconut shavings. Different cultures modified the cookie in other ways, incorporating ingredients that were familiar and readily available. In Nicaragua, where corn was more popular than wheat, cornmeal was used for the cookie base. Regardless of the specifics, alfajores are wildly popular sweets wherever they are found.

What I find most interesting about horseshoe crabs is their nine eyes, which are located on different parts of their undersides and can do several incredible things. For instance, this amazing crab can use its two largest eyes to magnify light from the sun. In my opinion, that’s pretty remarkable. Horseshoe crabs also have gills to extract oxygen from water, but can survive on land for up to four days if their gills stay wet, an important survival trait that most organisms don’t have. Their hard shell protects them, but it also sheds so that the horseshoe crab can grow larger. While they are still developing, horseshoe crabs will shed their shells about 18 times over the course of 10 years and can go on to live another 10 years as mature adults. And although their tails look like stingers, they aren’t actually sharp or dangerous. Horseshoe crabs use them to turn right-side up if they get turned over onto their backs. Such clever creatures!

As decades passed, more and more of these large fish have been sighted. Some have even been observed swimming upside-down, backwards, and vertically with their heads pointed downward. Where had these strange fish been hiding, and why do they swim so outlandishly? As it turned out, this peculiar fish species has been living near the bottom of the ocean, as deep as 2,300 feet below the surface. The dim and obscure depths of the ocean are perfectly suited to the coelacanth, whose eyes are quite sensitive to light. Scientists say that the coelacanth’s preference for lightless ocean habitats is why fishermen rarely see these fish during the daytime or even on nights when there is a full moon. Only when it is sufficiently dark will coelacanths emerge from their shadowy ocean lairs. And what about the coelacanth’s curious swimming technique? Well, it helps them hunt their prey, which is usually swallowed whole.

Though this often instills a sense of fear in those concerned about the well-being of the environment, beavers are no enemy of Mother Nature. As natural loggers, beavers do cut down trees, but they never clear every tree from an area. In fact, a beaver’s chewing stimulates growth in tree species like willows and aspens. Far from causing harm with their dams, beavers actually improve the environment as a whole. People will be pleased to know that beavers often lessen the impacts of droughts and floods and maintain wetlands that benefit insects, birds, and other species. Furthermore, the silt that accumulates within the dams contains microbes, which remove toxins and purify the water as it flows downstream.

2197.	I stared happily out the blurry window, watching the raindrops make their chaotic way down the cold glass. A hearty rainstorm is a good friend--comforting, reassuring, and always willing to help, in this case, with watering my yellowed lawn. I find it quite peculiar that there are people who dislike rain--that is, people who prefer the unrelenting harshness of the sun to a sweet, summer shower. I suppose there are those who consider me strange for liking rain over sunshine. Nevertheless, I shamelessly enjoy rainy days. I am happy to be cozily ensconced in my window seat with a good book and the pitter-patter of raindrops to keep me company through the dark afternoon.

As found in the passage, the phrase “a hearty rainstorm is a good friend” is an example of

My teammates and I are the defending champions, and it isn’t an easy position to be in. If we win today’s game, we will be the first consecutive champions ever; if we lose, it will devastate our loyal fans. This is a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and one that our opponents are determined not to give us. Since they are the host country, this final game is taking place on their turf. As captain of the team, I know that my players are strong. There isn’t a goal we can’t make or a shot we can’t block. The energy of the crowd, a participant in the game, is a force to be reckoned with as well. Like our coach said, this isn’t going to be easy, but it is going to be a lot of fun.

The noise was slightly louder, and just a bit more insistent this time, yet the woman still did not look up. Tap tap! This time the woman flinched, her focus suddenly shifting.

Kakapos began to disappear when humans first arrived on the main islands of New Zealand, primarily because humans introduced non-native predators such as cats, dogs, and rats. In an attempt to save these rare birds, in 1987 the kakapos were transferred to predator-free islands of New Zealand, where they were closely monitored in hopes that their dwindling population would strengthen. However, by 1995, there were only 51 surviving kakapos. Intervention efforts, such as protecting nests from other animals and keeping a watchful eye on eggs and chicks, intensified. During 2002, these efforts helped 24 chicks hatch and survive, and by 2006 the species had reached 86 individuals. The recovery efforts on behalf of this remarkable species continue to have a positive effect and, despite some adult deaths, the population in 2014 reached 126 birds.

Native Americans typically ate all parts of the pumpkin plant and frequently used the dried outer shells of pumpkins as storage containers. The nutritious pulp was prepared in a variety of ways. For example, it could be cut into long strips and dried in the sun, thus preserving it and making it an easy food to transport. Some people even wove the dried strips into pumpkin mats. When the colonists arrived in America, they incorporated pumpkin pulp into their recipes for drinks, stews, and soups. Centuries later, the popularity of carving pumpkins skyrocketed in the U.S. while the demand for pumpkin as a food ingredient dwindled. In response, farmers switched to producing hybrid varieties that were better suited for carving than for eating. Though pumpkins may not be consumed in the same quantity as they once were, tasty heirloom varieties are slowly making a comeback.

The history of cheese production in Wisconsin dates back to the 1800s, when European immigrants were attracted to the state’s fertile land. As Wisconsin’s population grew, so did the number of its dairy farms. In 1841, Anne Pickett, using milk from cows she rented from neighboring farms, established the first small-scale cheese factory, and a succession of cheese factories were opened by others soon after. With this rapid development, it became apparent that standards for marketing and grading cheeses were needed. In 1872, an association was formed in Wisconsin to implement policies for controlling the burgeoning industry. By 1886, the popularity of cheese production led to college courses in cheese making and by 1899, over 1,500 cheese factories existed in Wisconsin. To this day, Wisconsinites produce a variety of award-winning dairy products, including milk, cheese, and butter.

According to the passage, what role did Anne Pickett play in Wisconsin’s history?

In the mid-1700s, French colonists moved to South Louisiana from the Acadia region of Canada, and over time these Acadians became known as “Cajuns.” The Cajuns were resourceful people who lived off the land, hunting and fishing, and “Cajun” was later applied to their hearty, country-style cuisine. Traditional Cajun food combined French and Canadian influences, and relied on simple, rustic ingredients that were locally available. This differed from the more refined cuisine prepared in New Orleans in the 1700s for wealthy landowners of European ancestry, or “Creoles,” and which included more exotic and expensive ingredients in addition to local ones. Creole food was originally a blend of Spanish, French, and African flavors and influences. Visitors to Louisiana today can try modern Cajun and Creole dishes, which have evolved greatly over time, and explore their origins and history.

During their first summer of retirement, they caught salmon from a boat in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California, although the fish barely met the minimum size limit of 20 inches. They were luckier the second summer during a trip to Alaska, where they fished from the bank of a river on the Kenai Peninsula and each landed a king salmon that lived up to its name. The next year, I joined them fishing in Oregon along the Columbia River. The salmon were hardly biting, or maybe there just weren’t many around that year, because none of us caught a single fish. They decided to head northeast for salmon last year and learn how to fly fish at a lodge in Maine. They told me the technique was much more challenging to master, but on the very last day of the trip, they had success. Those salmon were the ones they were most proud of landing.

Major avalanches can travel at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour and result in snow that, once settled, is as hard and dense as concrete. Avalanches usually take place during or within 24 hours after a storm, especially if the storm produces an accumulation of at least 12 inches of snow. Moreover, avalanches require a trigger, or stressor, that affects layers of snowpack. Triggers most frequently occur naturally, but they can also be caused by human interference. One example of a natural trigger is melted and re-frozen snow that creates a slick layer of ice, which serves as an unstable foundation for newly fallen snow. Additionally, large temperature differences can make it difficult for the layers of snow to bond, creating a potential natural trigger. While the powdery clouds of an avalanche may look almost ethereal, it is important that people are aware of possible triggers and steer clear of avalanche terrain during high-risk periods.

According to the passage, large temperature differences make it difficult for layers of snow to 

A.	bond.

If you wish to create a private outdoor area, add vertical interest, or simply cover up an eyesore, such as the storage area for a garbage can, vines could be your solution. Some vines, such as honeysuckle, golden hops, or clematis, are perfect for a trellis or an arch. Other vines are more suitable for a solid surface or a wood fence. Good plant choices for those areas are ivies and trumpet creeper. For groundcover, choices range from low-growing plants with flowering spikes, such as ajuga, to evergreens that can spread as they grow to create a carpet of color, such as creeping blue spruce. Besides adding greenery, these plants can fill empty spaces that receive little traffic and provide beauty nearly year round.

During partial and annular solar eclipses, the moon blocks only a portion of the sun’s light from reaching the earth. During a total solar eclipse, however, the three bodies are in perfect alignment and the disc of the sun appears completely blocked by the moon. Whether a person sees a partial or total eclipse depends on where on the earth the person is located. This is because the moon, during the eclipse, casts two shadows on the earth’s surface: a relatively small “umbra” where no light falls and a much larger “penumbra” where a small amount of light falls. Only the people lucky enough to be in the umbra’s path, which may be only 90 miles wide, will see a total eclipse. Although the sun is far larger than the moon, the moon seems to cover the entire sun because the moon is so much closer to the earth. Safely viewing a total solar eclipse is a fleeting opportunity, because it lasts no more than seven and a half minutes.

According to the passage, a partial solar eclipse is observable when the 

A.	sun is farthest from the earth.

Here, petrified redwood stumps up to 14 feet wide and thousands of detailed fossils of insects and plants reveal the story of a very different, prehistoric Colorado. Scientific studies have been conducted at Florissant since the 1870s, and an important monograph about plant fossils in the area was published in the 1950s. Other research-driven excavations continue to be part of the park’s mission. For example, one study is comparing modern forests with the fossil flora at Florissant, and another is analyzing freshwater invertebrate fossils to understand the ancient climate. Fortunately, visitors are also welcome to travel back in time and learn from this amazing place. Tiny, fragile fossils of insects, plants, spiders, fish, cones, and seeds are on display in the visitor center. The petrified redwood stumps are easily seen along a favorite walking trail, and miles of other trails lead to views of elk, deer, and coyotes moving through the valley.

Picture this in your mind: Denser parts of a giant interstellar cloud of gas and dust collapse and condense under their own gravity, eventually breaking into clumps called protostars. As gas continuously accumulates in the center of a protostar, the heat and pressure in its core increases. Hydrogen ions and electrons move at high speed in the core, and eventually, the core becomes so dense and hot that nuclear reactions begin to occur. At this point, the protostar becomes a star. Now let your mind picture a future time, perhaps billions of years later: There is no more fuel for the nuclear reactions, the large star swells into a red supergiant and ends its life in a sudden explosion called a supernova. The supernova shines brightly for a short time and then fades, leaving behind a neutron star or black hole, amid a cloud of hot gas. This life cycle continues, as new stars are born.

According to the passage, rising density and temperature levels in protostars result in 

A.	red supergiants.

The house had somewhat of a foreign appearance; it was one of considerable pretension; it was a house which wanted to be surrounded by ancient trees, by noble gardens and stately lawns, and to be always kept deep in the country, far away from town houses and streets; in the surroundings of a city, apart from gardens, lawns, park and lordly trees, it would have been out of place and incongruous. The warm red brick of which it was built had long since mellowed with age; yellow lichen clung to the walls here and there; over one wing, that of the west, ivy grew, covering the whole of that end of the house.

The system of garden-decoration popularly known as “Subtropical,” and which simply means the use in gardens of plants having large and handsome leaves, noble habit, or graceful port, has taught us the value of grace and verdure amid masses of low, brilliant, and unrelieved flowers, and has reminded us how far we have diverged from Nature’s ways of displaying the beauty of vegetation, our love for rude color having led us to ignore the exquisite and inexhaustible way in which plants are naturally arranged. In a wild state brilliant blossoms are usually relieved by a setting of abundant green; and even where mountain and meadow plants of one kind produce a wide blaze of color at one season, there is intermingled a spray of pointed grass and other leaves, which tone down the mass and quite separate it from anything shown by what is called the “bedding system” in gardens. 

Based on the passage, the view of the narrator is most likely that gardens should

Time and experience have proved beyond question that skillful and judicious tea blending will be found to amply repay for all the study, labor and expense bestowed on it by the dealer, as the chief and only difficulty existing in the art lies in the fact of first finding a combination or combinations that will please the majority of consumers. But it is an egregious mistake to imagine that the successful or profitable blending of teas consists solely in the indiscriminate or injudicious heaping together carelessly and indifferently of two or more varieties or grades of tea in one homogeneous mass without the slightest regard to quantity, quality, affinity, affiliation or assimilation of leaf, liquor, character or flavor of the component parts.

As one comes to hunt for causes and inquire into the significance of things, one becomes a scientist. A thing or an event always points beyond itself to something else. This something else is what goes before it or comes after it,—is its cause or its effect. This causal relationship that exists between events enables a scientist to prophesy. By carefully determining what always precedes a certain event, a certain type of happening, a scientist is able to predict the event. All that is necessary to be able to predict an event is to have a clear knowledge of its true causes. Whenever, beyond any doubt, these causes are found to be present, the scientist knows the event will follow.

Which of the following best restates the author's main point?

The late Dr. George Ripley was wont to say that the secret of being agreeable in conversation was to be honorable to the ideas of others. He affirmed that some people only half listened to you, because they were considering, even while you spoke, with what fine words, what wealth of wit, they should reply, and they began to speak almost before your sentence had died upon your lips. These people, he said, might be brilliant, witty, dazzling, but never could they be agreeable. You do not love to talk to them.

Though details about her early years are uncertain, some historians believe that she was born near Canterbury, England, in the year 1640. It is said that as a young woman, she embarked on a sea voyage in 1663 and lived in Suriname, along the coast of South America, before returning to her native country in 1664. Behn had a reputation as a talented young woman and was respected by the aristocracy, including King Charles II, who commissioned her to serve as an intelligence spy in 1666. However, Behn was not fully paid for her service and went into debt trying to fulfill her duties to the king. After a brief incarceration in debtor’s prison, Behn started writing to support herself.

There are two widely used grading scales to differentiate types of graphite, the material at a pencil’s core. One grading scale is a numbers-only system, where #1 is the softest and darkest marking pencil, and, at the other end of the scale, #4 is the hardest and lightest. The second scale uses numbers and letters, where B and H refer to the blackness or hardness of the graphite’s mark. Using this scale, the blackness or hardness of the graphite increases with the value of the number, so a 4B pencil makes blacker marks than a 2B one does. Neither grading scale, however, is standardized; therefore, a #2 pencil made by one manufacturer may differ slightly from a #2 made by another. For general use, the #2 or its equivalent, the HB, is the preferred pencil because it is dark enough to be easily read and hard enough to resist smudging.

According to the passage, both of the common grading scales for graphite 

A.	include hardness as a criterion.

Human and animal hair react to humidity because of hair’s unique chemical structure, which is made up mostly of keratin proteins. The keratin proteins are wound into a coil, and the turns of the coil are held together by chemical bonds, called hydrogen bonds. These bonds contribute to hair’s strength, but they are broken each time hair gets wet, and they reform when hair dries. When humidity levels change from low to high, keratin proteins are less able to maintain hydrogen bonds, and hair length can increase by a very small percentage. In fact, hair is so sensitive to humid environments that scientists, from the late eighteenth century through the 1960s, used an instrument that recorded changes in hair length to measure the amount of moisture in the air. Depending on the type of hair a person has, the effect of humidity can be quite noticeable or barely detectable.

On those mornings, he eagerly explains each dream to his family over breakfast—recalling the details of how he had to run for his life, make important decisions with the president, or find his way home after navigating a labyrinth of tunnels and doorways. However, his sister and grandmother rarely share his enthusiasm. Most mornings they listen politely, but by the end of the story, they look pained, quickly changing the subject after responding with something like, “You have quite an imagination.” Mario feels they just don’t seem to understand how powerful and real his dreams seem to him. “Maybe I’m not communicating them clearly enough,” he thinks.

Based on the passage, the author’s main idea is most likely that

A.	dreams rarely involve realistic events.
B.	everyone interprets dreams differently.
C.	a person’s dreams may not captivate others.
D.	dreams are a reflection of our subconscious.

Some authors meticulously plan every plot detail before they begin writing, while others dive in with only a vague idea in mind, relying on their characters to propel the story. My mother belongs to the second class of writers. While she may have started out with a few concepts about Jermaine, her main character’s best friend, she later discovered that he worked summers as a cook at a resort in Italy to support himself during his college years. By getting to know Jermaine through her writing, she also learned that he studied nutrition and dreamed of opening a restaurant. After weeks of writing, my mother reported that Deana, the main character of her novel, actually met Jermaine when they worked together at the Italian resort, but neither one realized it until years later. With this new turn of events, my mother now recognizes that she has a different story in the works.

Based on the passage, the author’s main point about writers like his mother is that

A.	unfamiliarity with the characters can lead to rewrites.
B.	characters can inspire transformations in the story line.
C.	revisions to the plot can result in better characterization.
D.	relationships between characters are challenging to write.

The early years of Galileo were, like those of almost all great experimental philosophers, spent in the construction of instruments and pieces of machinery, which were calculated chiefly to amuse himself and his schoolfellows. This employment of his hands, however, did not interfere with his regular studies; and though, from the straitened circumstances of his father, he was educated under considerable disadvantages, yet he acquired the elements of classical literature, and was initiated into all the learning of the times. Music, drawing, and painting were the occupations of his leisure hours; and such was his proficiency in these arts, that he was reckoned a skillful performer on several musical instruments, especially the lute; and his knowledge of pictures was held in great esteem by some of the best artists of his day.

According to the passage, the young Galileo constructed machinery in order to

A.	occupy his free time.

Although many people are acquainted with meditation techniques that advocate deep focus and the recitation of a mantra, and that are typically practiced while seated, walking meditation may be less familiar. This form of meditation offers an excellent way to expand seated meditation practice beyond quiet rooms and retreats. Like seated meditation, walking meditation can help reduce stress and increase attentiveness. However, during walking meditation the eyes are open and the body is moving; therefore, it requires a bit more awareness of one’s surroundings than seated meditation. To start, find a short pathway in a relaxed setting and walk back and forth at a slow pace. As you walk, focus your attention on your body by being aware of its movements, breathing, and sensations. With practice, you can incorporate this technique into walks to and from work or even when walking down a building corridor. So, next time you feel sluggish, get on the move and give walking meditation a try.

According to the passage, walking meditation requires

A.	a familiar setting.
B.	energetic movement.

In the study, the researcher defined four types of renewal activities—health, removal, intellectual, and introspection—and interviewed business executives to learn which ones they engaged in to deal with stress. Renewal activities that fell into the health category were the most commonly used and involved regular exercise, adequate rest, and nutritious diet regimens. Activities of removal, like family time, concerts, or vacations, provided separation from the source of stress and were the second most common stress relievers. A variety of intellectual pursuits such as reading, solving puzzles, and hobbies were also reported to be relaxing. Finally, meditation, breathing techniques, and support groups, classified in the introspection category, were other effective activities used to combat stress. Perhaps trying some of these activities could help you feel renewed, too.

According to the passage, the most common type of renewal activities for executives was

A.	health.

A good warm-up session gradually stimulates the body’s cardiovascular system, reducing stress to the heart and increasing body temperature and blood flow to the muscles. In addition, stretching after the warm-up and cool-down may help decrease the risk of injury and muscle soreness. The cool-down period, which serves to ease the intensity of a workout, reduces blood flow at a safe rate. For many exercisers, cooling down is important because suddenly stopping intense activity can cause light-headedness as one’s heart rate and blood pressure drop rapidly. As an important beginning and end to exercise routines, warm-ups and cool-downs may aid the body in meeting the challenge of rigorous exercise.

According to the passage, a warm-up session before intense activity helps reduce

A.	heart stress.

There are several advantages to teens contributing to retirement savings accounts. The earlier teens start saving, the longer their deposits have to grow through interest and investment gains. Also, because many teens do not have to pay taxes on their earnings due to lower annual incomes, deposits made into retirement savings accounts early on could be tax-free. Furthermore, saving can teach teens good investment practices and encourage them to make saving a lifelong habit. Because a cosigner is often required on a retirement account for teens under the age of 18, it is the perfect opportunity for an adult family member to get involved and assist the teen with investment choices and planning. Saving now will likely pay off handsomely in the long run.

According to the passage, teenagers who begin saving for retirement

To start, stir the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Add the water and stir the mixture until the rough dough comes together, but be careful not to over mix. The dough should be allowed to rise at room temperature in a sealed bowl for up to 24 hours. After the dough has risen, place a large oven-safe pot in the oven for 30 minutes at 450 degrees. While the pot heats, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and form the dough into a single round ball. Carefully place the ball of dough into the preheated pot, cover, and bake for 30 minutes. Next, remove the lid and let the dough bake uncovered for up to 15 minutes longer, until a golden brown crust forms. Once the crust is formed, remove the bread from the oven and let it cool. The bread can then be sliced and saved for later, or enjoyed immediately.

[Buck] was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.

These live cultures are what convert pasteurized milk to yogurt during the fermentation process. The bacteria also break down lactose, a sugar found in most dairy products, making yogurt edible by people who are lactose intolerant and usually must avoid dairy items. However, some yogurt products are heat-treated after fermentation, which eliminates most of the active cultures. Therefore, before buying yogurt, look for evidence that it contains live cultures and check the expiration date to ensure that the product is fresh. Furthermore, because yogurt sweetened with high fructose corn syrup often includes too many unnecessary calories, buy plain yogurt and add fresh ingredients for flavor. Acting on these tips, savvy purchasers will reap the benefits of tangy, nutritious yogurt.

Known for the singularly unpleasant odor it emits when in bloom, this tropical plant has fascinating features. When not in its flowering stage, the plant looks just like a small tree; however, this tree-like structure is really a single branching leaf that can grow to a height of about 15 feet. After several months, the gigantic leaf dies and the plant’s underground tuber develops a new leaf. After at least seven years, instead of a branching leaf, the tuber produces a flowering structure. The structure comprises a massive spike, bearing flowers at its base instead of its top, and a ruffled sheath that covers the spike’s base. During the blooming process, the spike undergoes chemical reactions that increase its temperature to nearly 100ºF. Readying for pollination, the sheath slowly unfurls—revealing a deep maroon interior color—and the flowers emit an overpowering odor to attract carrion-eating beetles and flies. If the pollination is successful, seeds will form and the long cycle begins again.

According to the passage, what part of the titan arum heats up?

A.	branching leaf

Clovers are more commonly sown in the springtime in the Northern States and Canada than at any other season and they are usually sown early in the spring, rather than late. On land producing a winter crop, as rye or wheat, they can be sown in a majority of instances as soon as the snow has melted. That condition of soil known as honeycombed furnishes a peculiarly opportune time for sowing these seeds, as it provides a covering for them while the land is moist, and thus puts them in a position to germinate as soon as growth begins. Such a condition, caused by alternate freezing and thawing, does not occur on sandy soils. Where it does not so occur, sowing ought to be deferred until the surface of the ground has become dry enough to admit of covering with a harrow.

According to the passage, an opportune time for sowing clover seeds occurs when the soil is

A.	dry.

In 1559, Spanish conquistador Don Tristán de Luna sailed from a port in Mexico, at that time a Spanish colony, with over 1,400 people and 11 ships to establish the first settlement in what is now Pensacola Bay. However, a powerful hurricane hit shortly after de Luna’s group landed, ruining supplies and sinking five ships. Over the next two years, the surviving colonists endured continued misfortune, and many dispersed to Cuba or returned to Mexico. By 1561, the last few inhabitants abandoned the settlement, and it wasn’t until 1698 that the Spanish returned to present-day Pensacola and successfully established a permanent settlement. However, in 1719, Spain surrendered the site to France, and for the next one hundred years, French, Spanish, and British troops fought for control, with ownership changing hands multiple times. Finally, in 1819, the Spanish signed a treaty relinquishing Florida to the United States, and in 1845 the state became recognized as part of the union.

In the United States, it is a longstanding tradition that the Librarian of Congress appoints the poet laureate consultant in poetry, or simply poet laureate, to raise national consciousness of poetry. America’s first consultant in poetry—the title poet laureate was not used until 1986—was appointed in 1937. The custom of singling out a specific poet for recognition is not unique to the United States, however, but dates back to the Middle Ages, when poets were chosen to write verse to honor kings and other leaders. For example, the Italian writer Petrarch became the poet laureate of Rome in 1341. Some poets laureate have been famous, critically acclaimed writers, such as Alfred Tennyson, who was the poet laureate of England for over 40 years, and Robert Frost, named the American poet laureate in 1958.

The bees that pollinate our food crops can experience population declines due to disease, habitat loss, and famine; however, there are a few simple things that anyone can do to help support these important insects. For gardens or landscaping, choose native flowering plants and trees that bloom at different times to provide bees access to nectar and pollen throughout the growing season. Also, avoid flowers that are specially bred to have double blooms. Although they look showy, these blooms usually produce less nectar and, with their extra petals, make extracting pollen more difficult. Another way to support bees is by including bee-friendly fresh water sources near gardens. Because bees are poor swimmers, it is important that they have landing places close to the water’s surface. A birdbath with a rock in it to create an island, or even a pebble-filled saucer, will work just fine. Lastly, avoid chemical-based pesticides and rely on insects such as ladybugs and spiders to keep garden pests at bay. Together, these measures can help provide vital support for local bee populations.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Extra petals on double blooms give bees easier access to pollen.

During lavish events, courtiers and sometimes even the king would perform choreographed pieces. These carefully orchestrated extravaganzas often included song, music, and poetry as well as some of the ballet steps and positions that are still used today. During the late 1600s, ballet transitioned from the palace to the stage and was performed by professionals. By the 1800s, during the Romantic era, female dancers took center stage and began dancing on the tips of their toes, a technique called pointe. They also started to wear less-restrictive clothing, including long, flowing tulle skirts later called romantic tutus. Soon, choreographers emphasized stricter techniques and introduced demanding jumps, leaps, turns, and more formalized movements. In response, the much shorter, classical tutu was used to reveal more of the ballerina’s intricate legwork and footwork. Today, although classical ballet is still popular, the dance form has expanded to include contemporary ballet, which incorporates modern dance movements.

For example, acidic foods and carbonated beverages are damaging to tooth enamel. To enjoy them in a more healthful way, indulge in acidic foods only during meal times, rather than as snacks, thus reducing the amount of time acid is on the teeth. Also, acidic drinks should be swallowed quickly, rather than allowed to linger in the mouth, and people should rinse out their mouths with water afterwards to dilute the acid. Foods beneficial to teeth include raw produce with a crunchy texture, such as apples, carrots, and celery, which can actually help remove plaque. Additionally, high-calcium foods like cheese not only strengthen tooth enamel, but also mix with plaque and stick to teeth, creating a short-term barrier against damaging acids.

When measured from its source in the Andes Mountains of Peru, it is approximately 4,000 miles long and today traverses six countries: Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Venezuela. Though the entire river can be referred to as the Amazon, historically, different names were given to sections of the river that ran through regions where native people lived. For example, Peruvians still call the upper section Marañón, and Brazilians call another portion Solimões. The name Amazon originated in 1541 when a Spanish explorer named Francisco de Orellana became the first European to descend the river from the Andes to the ocean.

Though a temple was built in Sparta to honor him, where he was considered a hero, for centuries scholars have been unable to determine whether Lycurgus lived and, if he did, which institutions and traditions can be credited to him. Ancient historical accounts mentioning Lycurgus offer conflicting stories about his family history, birthdate, and the kinds of reforms he supported. Some modern historians believe that Lycurgus endorsed the partitioning of equal shares of land among the Spartans, the division of the population into three separate classes, and the distribution of power to a pair of kings, while others are less certain.

Fortunately, in the Northern Hemisphere, one of the most useful stars in terms of navigation is also one of the easiest stars to spot. Polaris, also known as the North Star, can often be located by recognizing its distinctive neighboring stars. To begin, locate the bowl of the Big Dipper constellation. This is made up of four stars, one at each corner of the large, square bowl of the ladle, or dipper. Next, find the pointer stars, the two stars that form the outer edge of the bowl and are farthest from the three stars in the Big Dipper’s handle. Now, imagine a line that connects and extends beyond the pointer stars. The first bright star along this line should be Polaris. To confirm, check for the Little Dipper constellation, which is a smaller, dimmer ladle. The North Star is the last star in the Little Dipper’s handle. Following these steps should make it much easier to spot Polaris in the starry nighttime sky.

According to the passage, what is the first step in spotting Polaris?

A.	Find the pointer stars.
B.	Visualize a connecting line.
C.	Identify the Little Dipper’s handle.

R&B combines elements of jazz, blues, and gospel music, offering a powerful, vocal-driven musical style that many describe as soulful and emotional. This type of genre often employs numerous instruments and elaborate production methods to produce a rich sound, while still keeping the melodic vocals, featuring riffs and runs, in the forefront. R&B is sometimes confused with jazz, possibly because many R&B musicians also have backgrounds in jazz and vice-versa, which may blur the distinction between the two genres. Furthermore, since the latter half of the twentieth century, R&B music has influenced other music genres, such as rock, country, and pop. By the 2000s, when electronic influences and beats inspired by hip hop gained popularity, R&B and hip hop were often distinguished by whether the lyrics were sung or rapped. If the genre’s past is anything to go by, R&B music is likely to continue to attract new followers in the years to come.

The passage suggests that R&B music

A.	competes with the jazz genre.
B.	emphasizes embellished vocals.
C.	has yet to reach its peak audience.
D.	relies on instrumental improvisation.

“To see the object as in itself it really is,” has been justly said to be the aim of all true criticism whatever; and in aesthetic criticism the first step towards seeing one’s object as it really is, is to know one’s own impression as it really is, to discriminate it, to realize it distinctly. The objects with which aesthetic criticism deals—music, poetry, artistic and accomplished forms of human life—are indeed receptacles of so many powers or forces: they possess, like the products of nature, so many virtues or qualities. What is this song or picture, this engaging personality presented in life or in a book, to ME? What effect does it really produce on me? Does it give me pleasure? and if so, what sort or degree of pleasure? How is my nature modified by its presence, and under its influence?

The passage suggests that art critics should possess a heightened sense of 

A.	self-restraint.
B.	self-awareness.

When the body is well fed and clothed, the next demand is for exercise. Our powers are given us to be used; and unless they are used they waste away. Nothing destroys power so surely and completely as disuse. The only way to keep our powers is to keep them in exercise. We acquire the power to lift by lifting; to run, by running; to write, by writing; to talk, by talking; to build houses, by building; to trade, by trading. In mature life our exercise comes to us chiefly along the lines of our business, domestic, and social relations. In childhood and youth, before the pressure of earning a living comes upon us, we must provide for needed exercise in artificial ways. The play-impulse is nature’s provision for this need. It is by hearty, vigorous play that we first gain command of those powers on which our future ability to do good work depends.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	importance of honest labor.
B.	value of playtime for children.
C.	fulfillment of basic human needs.

The hints which it is the object of this volume to convey are not meant for experienced archaeologists. They are rather addressed to those who, while anxious to observe and record the antiquities which they may see on their travels, are likely, owing to lack of training, to miss things that may be of importance, or, having observed them, to bring home an imperfect record. It is hoped also that they may catch the attention of some of those who are not interested in the subject, but, coming into possession of antiquities, may unwittingly do incalculable harm by allowing them to be destroyed or dispersed before any record has been made.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	proper method of handling antiquities.

When we read the lives of the most eminent painters, every page informs us that no part of their time was spent in dissipation. Even an increase of fame served only to augment their industry. To be convinced with what persevering assiduity they pursued their studies, we need only reflect on their method of proceeding in their most celebrated works. When they conceived a subject, they first made a variety of sketches; then a finished drawing of the whole; after that a more correct drawing of every separate part, heads, hands, feet, and pieces of drapery; they then painted the picture, and after all re-touched it from the life. The pictures, thus wrought with such pain, now appear like the effect of enchantment, and as if some mighty genius had struck them off at a blow.

In discussing great artists, the author’s primary focus is on their

A.	work ethic.

Close the eyes and look attentively at what goes on in the field of our vision. Many persons questioned on this point would say that nothing goes on, that they see nothing. No wonder at this, for a certain amount of practice is necessary to be able to observe oneself satisfactorily. But just give the requisite effort of attention, and you will distinguish, little by little, many things. First, in general, a black background. Upon this black background occasionally brilliant points which come and go, rising and descending, slowly and sedately. More often, spots of many colors, sometimes very dull, sometimes, on the contrary, with certain people, so brilliant that reality cannot compare with it. These spots spread and shrink, changing form and color, constantly displacing one another. Sometimes the change is slow and gradual, sometimes again it is a whirlwind of vertiginous rapidity.

In discussing what one sees with closed eyes, the author’s primary focus is on

A.	finding the images.
B.	admiring the images.

The ancient Egyptians even went so far in exaggerating the plant’s powers as to refer to Aloe vera as the “plant of immortality.” Widely cultivated for its ability to heal certain skin conditions, such as burns, Aloe vera has also been touted as an agent for lowering blood sugar levels in diabetes patients. However, though the topical use of substances from Aloe vera is reportedly harmless, there is a lack of scientific consensus regarding their actual healing abilities. In fact, oral ingestion of Aloe vera substances can be dangerous if they are consumed in large amounts. Considering these factors, therefore, it would be wise to pursue other options before treating a condition with aloe-based products.

From this place, which is about one hundred miles by the river above Bangor, thirty miles from the Houlton military road, and five miles beyond the last log hut, I proposed to make excursions to Mount Ktaadn, the second highest mountain in New England, about thirty miles distant, and to some of the lakes of the Penobscot, either alone or with such company as I might pick up there. It is unusual to find a camp so far in the woods at that season, when lumbering operations have ceased, and I was glad to avail myself of the circumstance of a gang of men being employed there at that time in repairing the injuries caused by the great freshet in the spring.

If so, you should know that not a five foot shelf of books, not even the ardent reading of a fifty foot shelf aided by prodigious memory will give you that enviable thing called culture, because the yardstick of this precious quality is not what you take in but what you give out, and this from the subtle chemistry of your brain must have passed through a mental metabolism of your own so that you have lent something to it.

A peculiar tenderness, a glamour of sensitiveness, covered everything. He was more alive to the beauty of the world about him, and the blue hills seemed to hang like an enchantment on the edge of the horizon. He felt both strangely boyish and richly mature. Something had been renewed in him. He was an Elizabethan, a man of a wonderful new youth, seeing strange lands rising out of the ocean, his head full of a new splendor of words and a new majesty of emotions.

Although regular exercise routines can be difficult to maintain while traveling, there are plenty of cardiovascular and muscle-building activities that people can perform while away from their usual workout environments. Experts claim that a fast-paced walk around an airport terminal while towing heavy luggage can help travelers stay in shape, and car travelers can squeeze in a circulation-boosting workout by taking a walk or jog around a roadside rest area. Because many muscle-building exercises require only body weight, exercisers need not bring bulky fitness equipment—such as yoga mats, sandbags, or push-up bars—or find hotels with on-site gyms. In fact, all that is needed for a good workout is appropriate footwear and clothing. If you feel that you must pack something in the way of exercise equipment, throw in a jump rope. It’s portable, inexpensive, and jumping rope is one of the most efficient aerobic exercises on the planet. As many on-the-road exercisers can attest, with a little effort, travel need not curtail your exercise routine.

Each speech or pitch has a catch: it must be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride, typically about thirty seconds—or about seventy words or less. It is therefore important that an elevator speech be concise and at a summary level, consisting of only three to five key points. When developing the speech, stay focused on major accomplishments, advantages, or unique qualities. Successful elevator speeches also include language that the listeners associate with value and emphasize how a product, service, or job candidate can benefit a business or organization.

All that is needed is one cup of sugar, one teaspoon of baking soda, coarse salt, one egg, one cup of peanut butter, and one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. To turn these simple ingredients into peanut butter cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Then, using a spoon or an electric mixer, blend together the sugar, egg, baking soda, and vanilla extract. Next, add the peanut butter and beat until thoroughly combined. Use a tablespoon to drop the dough onto the baking sheet. Lightly press each unbaked cookie with the back of a fork to flatten it, then add the finishing touch by sprinkling coarse salt on top. Bake the cookies for approximately 10 minutes or until the cookies begin to brown, and then transfer them to a wire rack to cool.

Broadly speaking, there is only one hotel in America. The pattern of it, which is a very rational pattern, is repeated in cities as remote from each other as the capitals of European empires. You may find that hotel rising among the red blooms of the warm spring woods of Nebraska, or whitened with Canadian snows near the eternal noise of Niagara. And before touching on this solid and simple pattern itself, I may remark that the same system of symmetry runs through all the details of the interior. As one hotel is like another hotel, so one hotel floor is like another hotel floor. If the passage outside your bedroom door, or hallway as it is called, contains, let us say, a small table with a green vase and a stuffed flamingo, or some trifle of the sort, you may be perfectly certain that there is exactly the same table, vase, and flamingo on every one of the thirty-two landings of that towering habitation.

In 1947, their father—then known as Jamie—his parents, and two siblings lived on a farm with dozens of farm animals. Horses and dairy cows moved between the barn and the pastures, pigs and goats lived in their respective pens, and dozens of chickens wandered freely around the barnyard. One early morning, when Jamie and his siblings were sitting on the porch swing waiting for the school bus, a bedraggled stray cat appeared from around the corner of the house. Upon spotting the children, the cat quickly jumped into an empty wood bin and watched them through the slats. A few seconds later, the cat darted out and began attacking their shoelaces. The cat wasn’t satisfied until each shoe was untied. The children were amazed by this small, yet incredibly brave, creature and named the cat Rascal.

It was first cultivated about 2,500 years ago by the ancient Greeks, who believed that asparagus could cure or prevent a variety of ailments. The Romans were also enthusiastic about asparagus, even introducing it to the lands they conquered. Unlike most vegetables, asparagus plants live for fifteen to twenty years. The spears or shoots of asparagus grow very quickly; in fact, if the conditions are right, they can grow as fast as half an inch per hour. They are harvested when they are six to eight inches tall. Moreover, a single asparagus plant can produce more than twenty-five spears during a seven-week harvest season. When the spring harvest is over, the last asparagus spears on each plant are allowed to mature, producing tall, fern-like foliage, which replenishes the plant’s root system in preparation for the next year’s harvest.

A few years after Charles’s 1927 solo transatlantic flight, archaeologist Alfred Vincent Kidder hired the couple to spend several weeks in the American Southwest taking pictures of prehistoric sites from an aerial perspective. Anne flew the plane while Charles took the photographs. Kidder was specifically interested in obtaining more information about the canals built by ancestral Puebloan people of the Four Corners region, but the long canals were difficult to trace from the ground. Aerial photographs offered Kidder the visual perspective and contrast he needed to view the canals in their entirety and discern more details about their construction.

The rocks of Wales are older and harder than the rocks of the plains; and as you travel from the south to the north, the older and harder they become. The highest mountains of Wales, and some of its hills, have crests of the very oldest and hardest rock—granite, porphyry, and basalt; and these rocks are given their form by fire. But the greater part of the country is made of rocks formed by water—still the oldest of their kind. In the northwest, center, and west—about two-thirds of the whole country,—the rocks are chiefly slate and shale; in the southeast they are chiefly old red sandstone; in the northeast, but chiefly in the south, they are limestone and coal.

The nightstand and bedframe were easy to assemble, but the four-drawer dresser was a bit more complicated. After unpacking all of the dresser pieces, Amanda mounted the rails for the drawers on each side of the frame. She then attached the crosspieces to connect the two sides of the frame together. Next, she turned the dresser frame over to nail down the backing. Amanda then assembled each drawer—front, back, sides, and bottom—and installed the corresponding rails on the sides of each one. When the drawers were finished, she set the frame on its end and attached the top piece of the dresser to the frame. After placing the dresser where she wanted it to go in her bedroom, she slid the drawers into place and smiled at her handiwork.

Based on the passage, what did Amanda do immediately after she attached the crosspieces?

A.	She placed the dresser where she wanted it to go.
B.	She attached the top piece of the dresser to the frame.
C.	She turned the dresser frame over to nail down the backing.

At the time, Graham was part of my everyday life, but we never really interacted while at school. For years, he remained in my periphery, always there but never grasping my full attention. Graham was taller than the other kids on the basketball team, but soft-spoken, rarely talking to anyone off the court. He usually kept to himself during lunch, choosing a spot near the back of the cafeteria where he read a book while he ate. My peers never mentioned Graham; they were focused on impressing the upperclassmen, mainly the juniors and seniors who were old enough to drive. Aside from our English teacher Mr. Whitman, who tried to convince Graham to join the poetry club, it seemed as though no one really noticed him at all.

The passage suggests that the narrator was

A.	scornful of Graham.
B.	shorter than Graham.
C.	younger than Graham.

For years to come, people would talk about this game. No one would ever forget the fateful night when the two archrivals went head-to-head in the longest championship game on record. The tie was finally broken during the fourth overtime period with a field goal in the final seconds. Even though the scoreboard clearly indicated one team the winner and the other the loser, the teams were so evenly matched that every single player on the field would leave a champion.

They said that I would experience difficulty meeting friends and socializing, and they insisted that the traffic would be maddening. Although their concerns were well intentioned, what my family failed to realize was that most big cities are just a collection of small towns. In Chicago, my neighborhood is the center of my social life, and practically everything I could possibly need is within walking distance. I always see friends and acquaintances while out and about, and save on car expenses by biking to work or taking the subway. With these advantages, I often wonder why it took me so long to move out of my hometown.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

Among the Italian schools of painting the Venetian has, for the majority of art-loving people, the strongest and most enduring attraction. In the course of the present brief account of the life of that school we shall perhaps discover some of the causes of our peculiar delight and interest in the Venetian painters, as we come to realize what tendencies of the human spirit their art embodied, and of what great consequence their example has been to the whole of European painting for the last three centuries.

Though she did not receive a formal education, Margaret was intellectual at an early age and satisfied her penchant for reading by visiting scholarly libraries. In 1645, she married William Cavendish, a nobleman who introduced her to a variety of influential thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes. Although she did not directly communicate with other philosophers about their work, Margaret Cavendish published fictional correspondences that demonstrated her knowledge of philosophy and scientific theory. These published dialogues allowed her to contribute her own ideas to discussions that excluded women. She made history when, in 1667, she received an invitation to participate in a meeting of the Royal Society, one of the first national scientific societies. Margaret Cavendish wrote extensively about a variety of subjects pertaining to literature, science, and philosophy, publishing over 20 books before her death in 1673.

In discussing the life of Margaret Cavendish, the author’s primary focus is on her

A.	advanced scientific theories.

A hard winter affects the chipmunks very little; they are snug and warm in their burrows in the ground and under the rocks, with a bountiful store of nuts or grain. I have heard of nearly a half-bushel of chestnuts being taken from a single den. They usually hole up in November, and do not come out again till March or April, unless the winter is very open and mild. Gray squirrels, when they have been partly domesticated in parks and groves near dwellings, are said to hide their nuts here and there upon the ground, and in winter to dig them up from beneath the snow, always hitting the spot accurately.

During the nineteenth century, importers insisted that tomatoes were fruits, which were exempt from the ten percent import tax levied against vegetables at the time. Although tomatoes were scientifically classified as fruits insofar as they bear seeds, the Supreme Court ruled that tomatoes were more commonly prepared and served as vegetables. According to the ruling, the importer was obligated to pay the vegetable import tax. While current science classifies tomatoes as fruits, most people think of tomatoes—as well as other fruits such as eggplants, bell peppers, cucumbers, zucchini, and pumpkins—as vegetables due to their savory flavor and incorporation into dinner entrées.

It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came there—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.

Far up the river the blue haze of the sky-fringed woodland blended into the purple shadow beneath the contrasting yellow of the bluffs, that looked down into the smooth waters, upon their own scarred and wrinkled images crowned with golden crowns by the last scant sunlight. The cottonwoods placed their long shadows like soothing fingers on the muddy madness of the central stream. The Night awakened in the east and stretched its long black arms into the west, and the glory vanished. The distant woodland and the bluffs grew into indistinguishable masses. The river became a faint film above a lower concave of dawning stars. The camp fires in the village reared long towers of light into the darkness, then fell back into a sleepy glow.

Of course, as the weeks and months slipped away, I gradually got more or less used to the new state of things, and the first sharp edge of my grief was dulled. The hardest hours of my day were those spent at table with Uncle Peter--alone with him, in a silence broken only by the clinking of our knives and forks. These were very hard, trying hours indeed. The rest of my time I passed out of doors, in the company of Sam Budd, our gardener's son, and the other village boys. What between swimming, fishing, and running the streets with them, I contrived to amuse myself after a fashion. Yet, for all that, the year I speak of was a forlorn, miserable year for me; I was far from being either happy or contented. My first violent anguish had simply given place to a vague, continuous sense of dissatisfaction and unrest, like a hunger, a craving, for something I could not name. That something was really—love: though I was not wise enough to know as much at the time.

Since becoming an adult, stress has been part of my everyday routine as I prepare for interviews, move to a new apartment, or get stuck in traffic on my way to a new job. For me, stress results in an unfortunate physical response, usually a faster heartbeat or a rise in blood pressure. While some experts say that stress can help sharpen one’s focus in preparing for a task, it can also negatively impact mental and physical health. Yet, after making some dietary changes by eating healthier, fresher foods, my stress level has decreased, and exercising regularly has also made a big difference. Additionally, practicing a positive attitude, maintaining emotional balance, and using healthy coping mechanisms for unexpected stressful situations have helped alleviate my symptoms of stress. When I made these small, but important, lifestyle adjustments, it was not long before I diminished my stress and began to feel healthier and happier once again.

The newlywed couple was spending the chilly evening indoors making pies when they heard a quiet knock at the door.

Because the levels of fluoride found naturally in drinking water may be too low to have a significant impact on teeth, many communities across the United States have added this remarkable mineral to their drinking water to improve citizens’ oral health. The fluoride in fluoridated water binds with tooth enamel to help teeth resist the acids produced by bacteria that thrive on sugary foods. Though some critics oppose fluoridation, because toothpaste containing fluoride is widely available, I disagree on the grounds that the amount of fluoride added to drinking water is safe. Ultimately, increased levels of fluoride have led to a significant decrease in tooth decay, making this mineral an important part of dentistry and oral health.

Based on the passage, the author’s attitude toward fluoridated water is

A.	curious.

One afternoon in the beginning of October when the traffic was becoming brisk a tall man strode along the edge of the pavement with a lady on his arm. Angry glances struck upon their backs. The small, agitated figures—for in comparison with this couple most people looked small—decorated with fountain pens, and burdened with dispatch-boxes, had appointments to keep, and drew a weekly salary, so that there was some reason for the unfriendly stare which was bestowed upon Mr. Ambrose’s height and upon Mrs. Ambrose’s cloak. But some enchantment had put both man and woman beyond the reach of malice and unpopularity. In his [case] one might guess from the moving lips that it was thought; and in hers from the eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a level above the eyes of most that it was sorrow. It was only by scorning all she met that she kept herself from tears, and the friction of people brushing past her was evidently painful.

The extravagance and uproar had become deafening, when at their height the door of the room in which the assembly sat at their obstreperous repast was suddenly flung open, and a portentously tall and mysterious figure, clad entirely in black, entered the apartment, and stood regarding the furious scene of folly in masquerade, if not with amazement, at least with a perfectly silent observation. The figure that thus so suddenly appeared was wrapped in a long rich cloak of a dark and heavy material, the face being entirely hidden by a mask hung with long black silk fringe. This apparition stood for a considerable time unobserved by our young racketers, who were too far engrossed in their own follies to take notice of anything else; but presently one, and then another, and then all of the individual members became aware of his presence.

Its shape is of a lotus bud, and the long fissures that plough a mountain side are now but delicate gold veining on a petal. Slowly it seems to open. It is the chalice of a new day, the signal and the pledge of consecration. Husky crows awake in the pine trees, and doves under the temple eaves.

Here and there were little dots of ranches, visible more by their vivid oat and alfalfa fields than by their small log cabins. Down the valley the river flickered, lifted by its brightness above the hollow that held it, till it seemed just hung there like a string of jewels.

All the objects of sight went by at a dance measure; the eyesight raced with the racing river; the exigencies of every moment kept the pegs screwed so tight, that our being quivered like a well-tuned instrument; and the blood shook off its lethargy, and trotted through all the highways and byways of the veins and arteries, and in and out of the heart, as if circulation were but a holiday journey, and not the daily moil of threescore years and ten.

There was something about the coast town of Dunnet which made it seem more attractive than other maritime villages of eastern Maine. Perhaps it was the simple fact of acquaintance with that neighborhood which made it so attaching, and gave such interest to the rocky shore and dark woods, and the few houses which seemed to be securely wedged and tree-nailed in among the ledges by the Landing. These houses made the most of their seaward view, and there was a gayety and determined floweriness in their bits of garden ground; the small-paned high windows in the peaks of their steep gables were like knowing eyes that watched the harbor and the far sea-line beyond, or looked northward all along the shore and its background of spruces and balsam firs.

Brightly colored birds darted from branch to branch, their chirps intermingling like a lighthearted serenade.

A shiver ran down her back, but it was caused by elation, not the cold weather. Ava’s daughter and son-in-law were going snowboarding, and they decided to bring Liam, her grandson, along. The thought of seeing him again brought a smile to her face. This will be his first time in snow, and she had prepared her camera to capture his expression when the cold flakes landed on his round cheeks. Ava thought about the many pictures she would take just as she glimpsed the visitors pulling up in the driveway.

Renata was confident that she had anticipated and accounted for everything, so she relaxed and allowed herself to imagine what life would be like after the events of the evening had transpired.

Watching student pilots practice for their certification exams in single-engine propeller planes is just one of the airfield’s many diversions. During certain times of the year, when major sporting events are held here, the airfield attracts an interesting assortment of private jets. Just last week, during a car racing tournament, my sister and I counted more than twenty jets parked at the airfield. Though my sister prefers the World War II-era military planes that show up in the fall for the airshow, I tend to be more interested in modern mid-size jets. In fact, my dream is to become an aircraft mechanic someday and work right here at my hometown airfield.

A.	airfield is a busy place during special events.
B.	narrator enjoys spending time with her sister.

Historians have found evidence that Persian soldiers wore boots with inch-high heels at least as early as the 1500s, for the purpose of securely straddling stirrups when on horseback. Eventually, shoes with heels spread to Europe, where higher heel height became associated with wealth and power. For example, Queen Elizabeth I was documented wearing high-heeled shoes, and in the early 1700s a portrait of King Louis XIV prominently featured him wearing shoes made with wide cork heels covered in red leather. Although heeled shoes fell out of favor first with men and then with women by the late 1700s, these shoes eventually made a comeback with women in the mid-1800s with the addition of brass heel pieces for extra support. By the mid-1900s, thin steel rods were embedded in very slender wood or plastic heels, making possible the very high, narrow heel known as a stiletto. Today, heels on boots, shoes, and sandals remain popular footwear options.

According to the passage, heeled shoes that reappeared during the 1800s included

A.	wide cork heels.

A lighter load can help improve a vehicle’s fuel economy, so emptying the trunk and back seat of any unnecessary items may help car owners save some money at the pump. Other ways to maximize gas mileage include changing the spark plugs regularly, ensuring that the tires are properly inflated, and using the recommended grade of motor oil. Parking in the shade, especially during the summer months, can help keep vehicles cool and help slow the evaporation of fuel. Furthermore, driving at lower speeds and making more gradual stops and starts not only reduces gas expenses, but can reduce wear on a car’s brake pads. Although potential savings depend on the make and model of the vehicle, these small changes can result in significant savings over time.

According to the passage, some actions that can improve gas mileage may also

A.	increase fuel evaporation.
B.	increase the wear on tires.
C.	extend the life of brake pads.

While the first chili recipe is difficult to attribute to any one person or culture, some suggest that the dish was originally concocted in Texas during the mid-1800s. Hot, filling, and inexpensive, it became a staple in the diets of cowboys and of pioneers traveling to the California gold fields. Records from 1887 note that a San Antonio, Texas, market featured stands where homemade chili, a tortilla, and a glass of water were sold for ten cents. Chili was also proudly sold in the Texas pavilion at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. In 1922 in Cincinnati, Ohio, a unique version of the spicy stew was created and served over spaghetti. Though chili became the official food of Texas in 1977, the state legislature of Illinois, where the dish is spelled “chilli,” named Illinois the “Chilli Capital of the Civilized World” in 1993.

The friendship between John Muir and myself was of that fine sort which grows and deepens with absence almost as well as with companionship. Occasional letters passed from one to the other. When I felt like writing to Muir I obeyed the impulse without asking whether I “owed” him a letter, and he followed the same rule—or rather lack of rule. Sometimes answers to these letters came quickly; sometimes they were long delayed, so long that they were not answers at all. When I sent him “news of his mountains and glaciers” that contained items really novel to him his replies were immediate and enthusiastic. When he had found in his great outdoor museum some peculiar treasure he talked over his find with me by letter.

She survived polio as a child and, at age fifteen, was studying pre-medicine at a prestigious school where she was among a very small percentage of female students. Three years later, in 1925, Kahlo sustained serious injuries from an accident that left her bedridden for over a year. It was during this recuperation period that she took up painting as a way to pass the time and created her first self-portrait. In 1929, Kahlo married muralist Diego Rivera, and the couple traveled to Europe and the United States for Rivera’s art exhibitions and mural commissions. Kahlo’s own success as an artist began after her first solo exhibition in New York in 1938, which was followed by an exhibition in Paris in 1939, and a later solo exhibition in Mexico City in 1953. Kahlo painted over sixty self-portraits and around eighty other works of art during her lifetime, and her work continues to be widely recognized around the world today.

The plant had grown considerably since Mateo first planted it, and he wanted to take the utmost care when moving it inside. Aware that rosemary plants prefer well-drained soil, Mateo lined the bottom of a clay pot with small pebbles and rocks and added potting mix before transplanting his rosemary. Then, Mateo moved the plant indoors before giving it a thorough watering.

Even in warm weather when one of these butterflies is suddenly disturbed it is likely to fold its legs upon its body and drop to the ground, allowing itself to be handled without showing any signs of life. This habit is doubtless of value, especially during hibernation or possibly during the summer lethargy or aestivation, the latter a habit which may be more general among these butterflies than is now supposed. As the insect lies motionless upon the ground it is very likely to blend so thoroughly with its surroundings that it becomes concealed, and any bird which had startled it from the branch above would have difficulty in finding it.

Feeding rabbits in winter to prevent their attacks on orchards has been practiced successfully, on the theory that it is cheaper to feed than to fight them. One plan is to leave the winter prunings of apple trees scattered about the orchard. Another is to furnish corn, cabbage, or turnips in sufficient quantity to provide food for the rabbits during cold weather. These methods have considerable merit, particularly the first, which seems to give satisfactory results when both mice and rabbits are present.

Once I’ve walked for about an hour, I pause, close my eyes, and take three deep breaths to help calm my nerves.

Most people attribute the invention of this marshmallow-flavored confection to a candy maker named George Renninger, who created it during the 1880s. When the candy was first produced, it was sold under the name “Chicken Feed” and packaged in boxes featuring a crowing rooster. The candy was targeted to farm dwellers, who at that time included about half of the American labor force. In addition to candy corn, confectioners produced a variety of other agricultural-centric treats, including candy pumpkins, turnips, and chestnuts. Nowadays, the harvest-themed candy corn is most popular during the fall season. And though the production methods have changed, candy corn’s main ingredients, sugar and corn syrup, remain the same.

A wood stain alters the color of wood in a lasting way and can be prepared from pigments, dyes, or a combination of pigments and dyes mixed with chemicals such as a dissolving agent, or solvent. While early forms of pigments were derived from the iron oxides found naturally in soil, chemists today produce synthetic pigments to achieve brighter, more vibrant colors. Similarly, dyes were once derived solely from natural sources; however, by the nineteenth century, synthetic dyes were improved upon when textile mills demanded brighter and longer-lasting colors. For wood stains, natural pigments were once preferred over natural dyes because the latter tended to fade quickly when exposed to sunlight. A key difference between a pigment and a dye is that pigments bond to the surface of wood, while dyes are absorbed into the wood fibers. The tradition of staining wood extends far back into history, and today the invention of synthetic pigments and dyes offers us a sumptuous selection of colors for our woodwork.

According to the passage, one difference between pigments and dyes is that

Natural indigo dye, made from the leaves of plants in the genus Indigofera, was introduced to Italy by sea trade with India in 1498. This dye produced a superior blue color and was referred to by Europeans during the Middle Ages as “blue gold” due to its scarcity and exorbitant cost. As early as the 1300s, indigo plants were cultivated and used to dye textiles in West Africa, where they also used the dye for tattooing and to color their hair and skin. Beginning in 1747, indigo was produced in the region of South Carolina and, when the value of the dollar dropped at about the time of the American Revolution, cakes of the dye were used in place of currency. With the introduction of synthetic indigo in 1897 came a much less expensive alternative and a sharp decline in the production of natural indigo worldwide. However, as modern day consumers seek authentic dyes over synthetic ones, natural indigo may enjoy a resurgence.

According to the passage, production of natural indigo after 1897 was greatly influenced by the

While commonly used for scrubbing pots and removing rust, steel wool is also used for a variety of other purposes, such as applying wax polish to wood. Containing no actual wool, this material got its start during the late nineteenth century when metalworkers realized that leftover metal shavings were effective in cleaning metal surfaces. Today, steel wool is manufactured by shaving thin threads of metal off carbon steel, stainless steel, or other metal rods and then bunching or weaving the threads together. The shaving process generates heat, so machine oil is applied to the cutting tool to reduce the friction and thus minimize the heat produced. Because some manufacturers do not remove the oil from the finished product, purchasers should be aware that steel wool could damage some surfaces and be a fire hazard. For safety, be sure to store steel wool away from potential sources of ignition, including open flames and batteries.

According to the passage, oil is applied during the manufacture of steel wool to

A.	remove rust.
B.	reduce friction.
C.	polish surfaces.
D.	prevent scratches.

Before seaweed can be put to culinary use, a few simple yet important post-harvesting steps are recommended. After collecting the mature seaweed from its native habitat, rinse it thoroughly several times in seawater to eliminate sand and sediments, and then check carefully for any small organisms, such as snails or crabs. Next, spread the seaweed thinly over a drying rack. During this stage, make sure there is adequate ventilation so that the seaweed dries quickly. Experts recommend building a drying rack in lieu of spreading wet seaweed on a tarpaulin, so that each part is thoroughly dried. Installing a raised cover over the rack will protect the seaweed from rain and nighttime condensation. Once it is dry, store the seaweed in a moisture-free area until it is ready for use. 

Based on the passage, what should happen just before checking the seaweed for impurities?

A.	Spread it thinly over a drying rack.
B.	Rinse it thoroughly several times.
C.	Harvest it from its native habitat.
D.	Store it in a moisture-free area.

The production process for these products involves three-parts: batching, filling, and finishing. During the batching stage, ingredients are combined in a large kettle, and heat is introduced to melt the mixture to a uniform consistency while it is being blended. During the filling stage, empty containers are moved down an assembly line by a conveyer belt, and each container is filled with the hot mixture. The finishing stage involves smoothing the top surface and releasing any trapped air bubbles before surrounding the sticks with cold air to solidify the product. Finally, the containers are sealed, washed, and then boxed for shipping.

Surely a foreword of explanation is called for from one who has the temerity to offer a surfeited public still another book on wild flowers. Inasmuch as science has proved that almost every blossom in the world is everything it is because of its necessity to attract insect friends or to repel its foes—its form, mechanism, color, markings, odor, time of opening and closing, and its season of blooming being the result of natural selection by that special insect upon which each depends more or less absolutely for help in perpetuating its species—it seems fully time that the vitally important and interesting relationship existing between our common wild flowers and their winged benefactors should be presented in a popular book.

Which of the following statements is suggested by the passage?

A.	Wild flowers tend to grow where a wide variety of insect pollinators live.
B.	Insect pollinators are essential to the survival of many types of wild flowers.
C.	Insect pollinators are undervalued in scientific publications on wild flowers.

To put it another way, if we would have the untroubled mind, we must transfer our conscientious efforts from the small details of life—from the worry and fret of common things—into another and a higher atmosphere. We must transfigure common life, dignify it and ennoble it; then, although the old causes of worry may continue, we shall have gained a stature that will make us unconscious masters of the little troubles and in a great degree equal to the larger requirements. Life will be easier, not because we make less effort, but because we are working from another and a better level.

The major emphasis of the passage is on

A.	disregarding the root of issues.
B.	following life’s natural course.
C.	shifting to a broader worldview.

Can we not look from different standpoints even on any part of the outer world? I see before me the ocean with its excited waves splashing against the rocks and shore, I see the boats tossed on the stormy sea and I am fascinated by the new and ever new impulses of the tumultuous waves. The whole appears to me like one gigantic energy, like one great emotional expression, and I feel deeply how I understand this beautiful scenery in appreciating its unity and its meaning. Yet would I ever think that it is the only way to understand this turmoil of the waters before me? I know there is no unity and no emotion in the excited sea; each wave is composed of hundreds of thousands of single drops of water, and each drop composed of billions of atoms, and every movement results from mechanical laws under the influence of the pressing water and air.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

I believe that the sun is about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it is a hot globe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth’s rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefinite time in the future. I believe that, if any other normal person comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted, and all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.

The character of Mr. Liston’s work is too well established to render it necessary for me to say anything in commendation of it. As an outline of surgical science, which is all that can be claimed for it, it is unrivalled in the English language. Written in a bold and graphic style, the distinguished author never hesitates to express his opinion, frankly and fearlessly, of what his judgment and experience have led him to disapprove. In this, as well as in some other particulars, he reminds one forcibly of that great and eccentric surgeon, John Bell. There is no cringing to this man or that, no doubtful or equivocal sentiment, no attempt to theorize or speculate; on the contrary, he comes right out, and clearly tells us what he means.

In offering you the fruit of my garden, which has been gathered from week to week, without much reference to the progress of the crops or the drought, I desire to acknowledge an influence which has lent half the charm to my labor. If I were in a court of justice, or injustice, under oath, I should not like to say, that, either in the wooing days of spring, or under the suns of the summer solstice, you had been, either with hoe, rake, or miniature spade, of the least use in the garden; but your suggestions have been invaluable, and, whenever used, have been paid for. Your horticultural inquiries have been of a nature to astonish the vegetable world, if it listened, and were a constant inspiration to research. There was almost nothing that you did not wish to know; and this, added to what I wished to know, made a boundless field for discovery.

However, as we approached a leather goods booth, I spotted the item that would remind me of a special fall spent abroad. When I pointed out the red journal, my sister’s reaction was memorable.

Then, she splashed all of the water out of the water bowl, and all three dogs rolled in the puddles. To further entertain themselves, Lettuce and Tomato played hide-and-seek in the sofa cushions for a while, and then Lettuce pulled a blanket off the couch and chewed on it.

It’s also a good idea to leave the carrier in plain view at home so that it becomes a natural part of your pet’s environment. I’ve found that getting Riley out of a soft-sided carrier once we arrive at the vet’s office is nearly impossible. A hard-sided carrier makes that process much easier because it can be taken apart. Lastly, you can also help calm your pet by playing soothing music during the drive to the vet’s office.

According to the passage, the author recommends using a hard-sided pet carrier because it

A.	can be taken apart.
B.	is more comfortable.
C.	provides more security.
D.	can be transported more easily.

He insists that corresponding via e-mail or text is faster and more efficient. While I can’t argue with that, I still like to sit down with pen and paper. When I get a response from my brother via the postal service, it makes me feel especially appreciated because, despite his preference for technology, he sat down and composed a handwritten letter to me. While most people today connect using technology, it’s clear that, when Jamal and I send and receive letters to each other, we are engaging in meaningful correspondence.

A.	The narrator is intimidated by the technology Jamal uses.
B.	Jamal prefers the privacy of electronic messages.
C.	Jamal’s letters make the narrator feel valued.
D.	The narrator is more thoughtful than Jamal.

Reading is made too easy nowadays, with cheap paper editions and free libraries. A man does not appreciate at its full worth the thing that comes to him without effort. Who now ever gets the thrill which Carlyle felt when he hurried home with the six volumes of Gibbon's “History” under his arm, his mind just starving for want of food, to devour them at the rate of one a day? A book should be your very own before you can really get the taste of it, and unless you have worked for it, you will never have the true inward pride of possession.

A man who came back to the place of his birth in the East, after an absence of a quarter of a century in the West, said the one thing he most desired to see about the old homestead was the spring. This, at least, he would find unchanged. Here his lost youth would come back to him. The faces of his father and mother he might not look upon; but the face of the spring, that had mirrored theirs and his own so oft, he fondly imagined would beam on him as of old. I can well believe that, in that all but springless country in which he had cast his lot, the vision, the remembrance, of the fountain that flowed by his father’s doorway, so prodigal of its precious gifts, had awakened in him the keenest longings and regrets.

Which of the following is most likely the man’s motivation to return to the spring at the old homestead?

All the characters in the pictures had to be assigned and dealt out among us, according to seniority, as far as they would go. When once that had been satisfactorily completed, the story was allowed to proceed; and thereafter, in addition to the excitement of the plot, one always possessed a personal interest in some particular member of the cast, whose successes or rebuffs one took as so much private gain or loss.

Unfortunately, many public schools offer few opportunities for students to engage deeply in the fine arts. Policy makers need to be made aware of research that has found a correlation between students’ participation in fine arts classes and better discipline, attendance, graduation rates, and higher test scores. Moreover, access to art classes in high school was found to markedly increase a student’s likelihood of earning a college degree. However, the true value of arts education cannot be quantified with research studies and statistics alone. All students should have the chance to participate in fine arts classes so that they may develop as well-rounded individuals and succeed academically.

The author of the passage is most likely trying to

A.	persuade students to take fine arts education classes.
B.	argue for widespread fine arts education in schools.

As with many agencies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has undergone changes to its name, function, and parent agency over the years in accordance with changes to the laws it regulates. Although it started out as the Division of Chemistry under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture in 1862, the modern era of what is now known as the FDA dates back to 1906, when the Pure Food and Drugs Act was signed into law. This act prohibited the sale of adulterated or misbranded foods, beverages, and medications. In 1927, the agency was renamed the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration. That name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration in 1930, the title used today. The FDA’s parent agency changed in 1940, when the FDA was moved to the Federal Security Agency. In 1953, the FDA again was transferred, this time to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). Further changes to HEW led to the FDA’s current home, the Department of Health and Human Services, in 1980.

There was nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance.

Yet another name was given him by the children to whom he taught poetry and music, and many called him the Blind One, because his eyes, dim with age, were overhung by swollen lids, reddened by the smoke of the hearths beside which he was wont to sit when he sang.

As you may know, a price floor is the lowest legal selling price for a commodity. Though governments often set price floors to prevent prices from being too low, with an aim to protect farmers, what I believe most often happens as a result of this policy is that farmers tend to overproduce. My objection to such policies, in general, is that while farmers initially benefit from selling their crops at higher prices, over time the farmers end up selling fewer crops because many consumers are unwilling to pay that price. When this occurs, a surplus of those crops is created, leading to even more problems. I could go on and on, but it’s already quite evident that price floors undermine the market and harm the economy.

I had always considered uniforms undesirable because I felt they hindered creativity and self-expression. However, much to my amazement, I am now a complete convert. Knowing what my child is going to wear every day of the week provides me with a profound sense of relief. I no longer need to spend time in the morning sorting through outfits or finding coordinating pieces that are clean enough for school. Instead of seeking out unusual clothing or shoes to emphasize individuality, my child, I’ve found, is absorbed in paintings, writing stories, decorating school folders, and a variety of other outlets for making a statement to the world. We have time in the morning to eat breakfast together, take our dog for a walk, or even review homework before leaving for school. Who knew that a free-spirited person like me would actually enjoy dressing my child in a school uniform?

Which of the following terms best characterizes the tone of the passage?

A.	amused

It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I’d had a bed, because a body don’t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there’d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you’d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!—bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum—and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit—and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager.

A dozen rods or more from the Red River bank stood the dwelling-house, and nowhere upon the plantation had time touched so sadly as here. The steep, black, moss-covered roof sat like an extinguisher above the eight large rooms that it covered, and had come to do its office so poorly that not more than half of these were habitable when the rain fell. Perhaps the live-oaks made too thick and close a shelter about it. The verandas were long and broad and inviting; but it was well to know that the brick pillar was crumbling away under one corner, that the railing was insecure at another, and that still another had long ago been condemned as unsafe.

Dmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium height and agreeable countenance, looked older than his years. He was muscular, and showed signs of considerable physical strength. Yet there was something not healthy in his face. It was rather thin, his cheeks were hollow, and there was an unhealthy sallowness in their color. His rather large, prominent, dark eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yet there was a vague look in them, too. Even when he was excited and talking irritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed something else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing. “It's hard to tell what he’s thinking,” those who talked to him sometimes declared.

Outwardly the Professor did not appear like the savant he was reported to be. He was small of stature, plump of body, rosy as a little Cupid, and extraordinarily youthful, considering his fifty-odd years of scientific wear and tear. With a smooth, clean-shaven face, plentiful white hair like spun silk, and neat feet and hands, he did not look his age. The dreamy look in his small blue eyes was rather belied by the hardness of his thin-lipped mouth, and by the pugnacious push of his jaw. The eyes and the dome-like forehead hinted that brain without much originality; but the lower part of this contradictory countenance might have belonged to a prize-fighter. Nevertheless, Braddock’s plumpness did away to a considerable extent with his aggressive look.

Very many years ago, in a valley a few miles from the coast, there stood a French château, beautifully situated in a handsome park near the Norman village of Carolles. The rich woodland scenery, the green pastures with their large wild fences now laden with wild roses; the shady lanes, whose banks will soon be covered with the long, bright green fronds of the hartstongue, and the delicate drooping trichomanes; the fine timber, and the picturesque farmhouses with their thatched roofs nestling in the valleys—all tend to give a home-like English air to the scenery of Normandy.

It is just in the way it is done that lies the whole difference between commonplace gardening and gardening that may rightly claim to rank as a fine art. Given the same space of ground and the same material, they may either be fashioned into a dream of beauty, a place of perfect rest and refreshment of mind and body—a series of soul-satisfying pictures—a treasure of well-set jewels; or they may be so misused that everything is jarring and displeasing. To learn how to perceive the difference and how to do right is to apprehend gardening as a fine art. In practice it is to place every plant or group of plants with such thoughtful care and definite intention that they shall form a part of a harmonious whole, and that successive portions, or in some cases even single details, shall show a series of pictures.

There is one pleasure even greater than that of reading, and that is being out of doors. To read at such a time seems to imply one of two things: either that the reader knows Nature thoroughly, or is indifferent to such knowledge. The former phenomenon the world has never seen; the latter, to speak mildly, deserves our pity. To escape ridicule, which is something, to insure happiness, which is more, to avoid great dangers, which is of even greater importance, one must know something of Nature. In one sense she is our persistent foe. She mantles with inviting cover of rank grass her treacherous quicksands; she paints in tempting colors her most poisonous fruits; she spreads unheralded the insidious miasma from the meadow and the swamp; but neither the quicksand, the unwholesome fruit, nor noxious vapors is an unmixed evil.

With a murmur, so soft it was almost imperceptible, glided the stream, blue as the heaven it mirrored, between banks now green and gently shelving away, crowned with a growth of oak, hickory, pine, hemlock and savin, now rising into irregular masses of grey rocks, overgrown with moss, with here and there a stunted bush struggling out of a fissure, and seeming to derive a starved existence from the rock itself; and now, in strong contrast, presenting almost perpendicular elevations of barren sand.

If you must venture out, make sure you are alert and well rested before getting behind the wheel. Dress warmly, bring along food and water, and to prevent carbon monoxide build-up inside the car, ensure that the tailpipe is clear of snow and ice. It’s always a good idea to keep your gas tank at least half full to avoid a freeze-up in the fuel line. Also, check your tire pressure regularly during the snowy months, because under-inflated tires can cause your vehicle to react more slowly to steering changes. Moreover, attend carefully to your driving style during inclement weather. Accelerate and apply the brakes gently and smoothly, as this will help the vehicle maintain traction and reduce the chance of skidding. Finally, if you get stuck on the road, run the engine and heater just long enough to warm the car, and then turn the engine off to conserve fuel.

According to the passage, keeping a car’s gas tank adequately full during inclement weather will

A.	help maintain traction.
B.	improve fuel efficiency.
C.	avoid a freeze-up in the fuel line.
D.	prevent carbon monoxide build-up.

People who happen to be indoors during an earthquake should not go outside, but rather get on their hands and knees and seek cover under a sturdy table or desk. If there is no suitable cover nearby, experts advise people to sit next to an interior wall, preferably away from heavy furniture or anything else that might topple or slide, and to cover their heads and necks with their arms. Moreover, since doorframes are typically no stronger than other parts of modern buildings and offer no protection against falling or flying objects, people should avoid standing in a doorway. Finally, it is advised that people stay put until the shaking stops.

According to the passage, which of the following actions is recommended if one is inside a building during an earthquake?

A.	Stand in a doorway.
B.	Exit to the outdoors.

Sheet-metal boilers are constructed at the factory, ready to be installed, but the cast-iron type is made in sections and assembled to make a complete boiler, at the time the plant is erected. Sectional boilers are convenient to install, on account of the possibility of handling the parts in a limited space, that would not admit an assembled boiler without tearing down a part of the basement for admission.

In those days, the festivities were regarded as both sacred and secular and served as opportunities for young Greek athletes to showcase their physical strength and agility. In 146 BC, after Rome conquered Greece, the Olympic Games expanded to include athletes who were not of Greek origin. One of the most famous Olympic champions is Milo, who won the first of his six Olympic wrestling events in 540 BC. The first record of a female Olympic champion, four-horse chariot driver Kyniska, occurred in 396 BC, though the victory officially belonged to the horses’ owner. Another ancient Olympian athlete, Melankomas, was victorious in 49 AD and was known for his defensive rather than offensive boxing moves. The Olympic Games endured for almost twelve centuries, when in 393 AD Emperor Theodosius banned them. Since the revival of the modern Olympic Games in 1896, many consider the Olympics the world’s most important sports competition.

The masses of white, silver and messmate gum-trees that clothe these same Adelaide hills so thickly, formed a grateful resting-place for the eye, wearied with the steadfast glare of sunshine. So did the vineyards that dot their declining slopes, and the gardens and orchards that are scattered broadcast to the east of the town. But even Adelaide itself is interwoven with the foliage of trees, which do so much to mitigate, both for eye and body, the severities of a semi-tropical climate. This fascinating embroidery of trees is more especially observable in glancing over North Adelaide. This extensive and important suburb, which is divided from Adelaide proper by the Torrens Lake and Park Lands, lies considerably above the city and adjacent suburbs. So large a proportion of the houses are surrounded by gardens, that from some points of view North Adelaide looks like a well-trimmed wood, thickly studded with houses.

The earliest known contemporary picture of a submarine vessel appeared in the “Gentleman’s Magazine,” in 1747. It showed a cross section of an underwater boat built and navigated on the Thames by one Symons. This was a decked-over row-boat, propelled by four pairs of oars working in water-tight joints of greased leather. To submerge his vessel, Symons admitted water into a number of large leather bottles, placed inside the hull with their open mouth passing through holes in the bottom. When he wished to rise, he would squeeze out the water with a lever and bind up the neck of each emptied bottle with string. This ingenious device was not original with Mr. Symons, but was invented by a Frenchman named Borelli in 1680.

According to the passage, which of the following parts was critical to submerging the submarine?

A.	oar
B.	lever

The aboriginal implements known as “chisels” are round, elliptical, or rectangular in section. The flint and jasper specimens are generally widest at the edge, the reverse being usually the case with those of other material. Most of them have marks of hammers at the blunt end, though some are polished at the top and a few, from eastern Tennessee, are sharp at both ends. The top (except in the double-edged ones) is usually flat, though a few are pointed or very thin, almost with cutting edges. Jaspers and flints are chipped, with the facets polished, the edges highly so. Any form may occur in any locality. Almost invariably they have scraper-form edges. The length is from 2 to 6 inches.

Perhaps the most remarkable evidence of animals showing a comprehensive intelligence of musical pitch is demonstrated by cavalry horses. That they thoroughly understand it is clearly demonstrated by the fact that they will obey the calls of the bugle for cavalry evolutions without a moment’s hesitation and with no suggestion from outside sources. These bugle calls are produced by a combination of four notes, each of a different pitch, and it is rarer to find a horse making a mistake in the musical orders given than it is for their masters.

Born in 1885 in Moorestown, New Jersey, Paul earned advanced degrees in a variety of disciplines, including biology, sociology, economics, and law. She lived for a time in England, where she worked, studied, and had the opportunity to meet several leaders of the British women’s suffrage movement. Upon returning to the United States in 1910, Paul and a fellow activist began leading a women’s voting rights movement in the United States. In 1913, Paul helped organize a parade for this cause the day before President Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration, which, at the time, was the largest parade that had ever occurred in the nation’s capital. Paul’s efforts, along with those of many others, ultimately led to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, which prohibits denying the right to vote on the basis of gender. Paul remained an activist throughout her life, advocating for additional federal legislation to ensure women’s freedom from legal discrimination.

Despite her special fondness for figs, however, Daria acknowledged that others believed her apricot trees produced the tastiest stone fruit in the region. Her apple trees, located across the road from the apricot trees, were beginning to drop their fruit in the long grass, and Daria pretended to be on a treasure hunt for apples. Usually at the day’s end, after gathering plenty of fruit, Daria would duck under the arching boughs of the old pine tree to breathe the cool air that blew in from the coast. This tree was reputedly brought over from Greece by her great-grandfather. Today, however, she was working at the village market, so she slowly made her way down the dusty road to town.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about Daria is correct?

A.	She has a difficult time finding ripe apples.
B.	Her fruit is sold at the town market.
C.	Her fruit trees are from Greece.
D.	She prefers figs to apricots.

After reading the directions on the box, Renato realized that the task wasn’t at all difficult. Renato began by emptying the powdered pudding mix into a mixing bowl and then measuring out two cups of cold milk and pouring it over the pudding mix. Next, he stirred the mixture with a fork for a few minutes, until no lumps remained. After that, he poured the liquid pudding into serving bowls and then placed the bowls in the refrigerator so the pudding would chill and solidify. The pudding was supposed to chill for about half an hour, but sometimes Renato became impatient and helped himself to a serving after only five minutes.

Based on the passage, what did Renato do immediately after he eliminated the lumps?

A.	stirred the mixture with a fork
B.	measured out two cups of cold milk
C.	helped himself to a serving of pudding

Yellow pins marked her business trips to Madrid and Barcelona in Spain, while a green pin represented her vacation to Dublin, Ireland. There were two blue pins in Iceland that brought back memories of her summer internship there. Brown pins reminded Carmen of the sands of Egypt and the magnificent pyramids that her grandfather had waited decades to see. Closer to home, red pins traced her travels through the Yucatan peninsula. The United States, from coast to coast, was marked with a dotted line of bright purple pins. On the table beside the map was a box of orange pins that Carmen had purchased to mark her trip to Kenya next month. Carmen enjoyed traveling for work and for pleasure, and she hoped that in ten years her map would be covered with even more colored pins.

When I first received these boots, I wore them almost every day, even if another pair of shoes would have looked better or been more practical to wear that day. Even after ten years, I still apply leather conditioner to the boots every week to keep them moisturized and looking like new. Over the years, they have lost their original rigidity and have become amazingly supple. In fact, I would argue that they are almost as comfortable as house slippers, and they definitely have more character than tennis shoes. I have bought other pairs of boots since, but this pair will always be my favorite.

I tried again and received the same results. Fortunately, I knew exactly what the problem was, and I was prepared. I popped the hood and retrieved the jumper cables from my trunk. Then, I asked my neighbor if she could help me jump-start my battery, and she agreed, meeting me in the driveway in a matter of minutes. We popped the hood of her car, attached the cables to the appropriate battery terminals of each battery, and she started her car. After a few minutes, I attempted to start my vehicle. When my car started, I knew our efforts had been successful. My neighbor noticed that the interior car light was on, which reminded me that I had switched it on last night to find my cell phone and must have forgotten to turn it off before going into the house.

However, I always seem to perform well on, and be most interested in, assignments that involve recognizing patterns within numbers. Maybe my fascination started with the street number of my childhood home: 3981. I couldn’t have asked for a better address, one in which the order of the numbers had a mathematical meaning:  three is the square root of nine, and nine is the square root of 81. Then there was the time my school project partners exchanged phone numbers. I said I would have no trouble remembering the phone number that was a palindrome. My partners gave me confused looks, and I realized that others had not noticed the numerals read the same forward as backward. Not all numbers fall into such neat configurations, and it takes a careful eye to appreciate them when they appear in everyday life.

In my opinion, however, that confusion is most often due to a lack of familiarity rather than any inherent complexity in design. Studies have shown that roundabouts can be safe and efficient alternatives to other types of intersections, and they may even lead to less air pollution. However, some drivers, unacquainted with the rules and unfamiliar with the traffic signage, fail to slow down as they enter the roundabout or to yield to traffic already within it. In roundabouts where two four-lane roads intersect, creating multiple lanes that circle the center island, inexperienced roundabout drivers might fail to get in the proper lane before entering and can end up missing their exit. When this happens, they can simply drive around the circle again, this time getting into the correct lane for their intended turn. With enough experience, the confusion should vanish.

In discussing roundabouts, the author's primary focus is on the

A.	challenges they present to unaccustomed drivers.
B.	signage required to direct drivers through them.

The high altitude, extreme temperatures, and demanding recreational opportunities have made me physically and mentally prepared to deal with almost anything. As many mountaineers know, accomplishing tasks at a high altitude is not for the faint of heart. Lowlanders who visit “the high country” on vacation often experience altitude sickness if they participate in rigorous activity without first acclimatizing for a few days by slowing down, taking frequent breaks, getting lots of sleep, and drinking plenty of fluids. Even after months in the mountains, day-to-day life is definitely harder here, because mountain culture emphasizes toughness and self-reliance. But it is also very rewarding—the beautiful scenery, fresh air, and encounters with wildlife make the everyday challenges worthwhile.

In the passage, the author’s purpose is most likely to

A.	compare mountain life to lowland life.
B.	warn travelers about the risk of high altitude.
C.	argue that mountain life makes people hardier.

It started out as a grand hotel, but after the stock market crash of 1929, had been used for other purposes, including as office space for the electric company. Following decades of neglect, it was at one point condemned and sat vacant until a new owner took possession. The overgrown shrubbery and trash that had accumulated over time around the entrance were quickly removed and replaced with elegant landscaping and flowering plants. A new energy grew around the building as money poured into the repairs. The bricks were cleaned until their original russet color was revealed beneath the grime, and the missing mortar and broken windows were replaced. In addition, the interior of the structure was faithfully restored to its former grandeur, complete with period furniture and fixtures. When the renovations were complete and guests started checking in, the entire town seemed rejuvenated.

In the passage, the author’s purpose is most likely to

It seems as though a child can go for months without growing an inch and then one day outgrows an entire wardrobe—everything from head to toe needs to be replaced. The cost of doing so can be considerable. Then, when children become old enough to play sports, an even larger clothing budget is needed for uniforms and sports-related attire. Moreover, the price of every garment increases when children reach high school, which adds to the burden. Though expenses for children are the responsibility of their parents, and my children are appreciative of everything I buy for them, I wasn’t prepared for the amount of money I have to spend in this category each year.

I walked quickly over the yellow plain. It was elastic, like flesh and seemed to sweat beneath my tread. The sea had been there very lately. Now I perceived it at a distance, escaping out of sight, and I no longer could distinguish the line which separated the sands from ocean. I felt as though I were looking at a gigantic supernatural work of enchantment. The Atlantic had just now been before me, then it had disappeared into the sands, just as scenery disappears through a trap; and I was now walking in the midst of a desert. Only the feeling, the breath of the salt-water, remained in me. I perceived the smell of the wrack [seaweed], the smell of the sea, the good strong smell of sea coasts. I walked fast; I was no longer cold. I looked at the stranded wreck, which grew in size as I approached, and came now to resemble an enormous shipwrecked whale.

With the many protections offered to cardholders by credit card companies, such as monitoring for fraud detection, I had not realized what a hassle it would be to have to replace a lost card. First, I had to call in the loss to my credit card company by phone, and then I had to follow that communication up with a secure e-mail to the company with details about when I noticed I had lost the card and my account number. Next, I had to review a list of recent charges to my account to verify that all of them were valid. After squaring away the charges on the lost card, I had to await the receipt of my replacement card. As soon as the new card arrived, I had to activate it and then notify all the automatic payees—such as my insurance carrier and internet service provider—of the new credit card number and expiration date.

Amid such restricted and unromantic environments the boy developed into the man. The intellectual fire burned slowly, but with a steady and intense glow. Although denied the requisite training of the schoolroom, he was nonetheless competent to cope with those who had undergone that discipline. No one had a more retentive memory. If he read or heard a good thing it never escaped him. His powers of concentration were intense, and in the ability through analysis to strip bare a proposition he was unexcelled. His thoughtful and investigating mind dug down after ideas, and never stopped till bottom facts were reached. With such a mental equipment the day was destined to come when the world would need the services of his intellect and heart. That he was equal to the great task when the demand came is but another striking proof of the grandeur of his character.

In 1959, Plante garnered the attention of hockey fans, coaches, and other players when, after sustaining a severe injury to his face during the game, he returned to the ice wearing a mask. Plante was adamant that he wear the mask that he had routinely worn only during practices. While Plante’s coach was initially unsupportive of his player’s request, he didn’t have much choice, because Plante was his only goalie. Plante’s stubborn resolve paid off, and other goaltenders followed his lead and began donning masks—protecting the players from countless injuries.

Before rubber erasers were invented, people commonly relied on moist, balled-up pieces of bread to remove unwanted graphite marks. Though these early bread erasers were readily available and inexpensive, they were also susceptible to the elements and would become moldy and deteriorate. In 1770, English scientist Joseph Priestly noted that a substance known as caoutchouc, now known as latex, was very effective in erasing pencil marks from paper. He subsequently named the useful substance “rubber” for its ability to rub away pencil marks. Priestly’s contemporary, Edward Nairne, was considered the first to develop and sell rubber erasers in Europe. Nairne claimed that he realized rubber’s erasing properties when he accidentally grabbed a piece of rubber instead of a ball of bread to erase graphite marks. Erasers have come a long way since the eighteenth-century and are now commonly made of synthetic rubber or vinyl compounds.

To make corks, harvesters first identify mature trees and then carefully remove from them sections of outer bark, which will grow back and can be harvested again in eight to fourteen years. Next, the cork planks are stacked on stainless steel pallets and stored for at least six months to stabilize their moisture content. After resting, the planks are sorted and those of adequate quality and thickness are boiled to remove any extraneous materials. The planks are cut into strips, and then cylinders of cork are punched out, each one a natural cork stopper. The remaining cork material is ground up and molded together to make other products, such as cork flooring.

Next, the colored mixture is poured into preheated molds. Cool water circulating around the molds cools and hardens the mixture in less than ten minutes. Then, hydraulic pressure is applied to the molds to eject the crayons, which are inspected for defects. Crayons passing inspection are pushed through a label machine that glues labels onto them, and then the final product is packed into boxes.

Modern contact lenses that rest on the eyes’ surface to improve vision are worn safely and effectively by tens of millions of people in the United States, thanks to several centuries of work by many innovators. Back in 1637, scientist René Descartes proposed a water-filled tube with a lens on one end that could be placed against the eye, conceivably to produce an enlarged image on the retina. Much later, in 1827, the astronomer Sir John Herschel conducted research on corneas and suggested it would be possible to produce corrective lenses from a mold made of a person’s eyes. A few decades later, work by Dr. A.E. Fick led to production of the first glass contact lenses, which were uncomfortable and covered the entire eye. Within another fifty years, in 1936, C. Feinbloom pioneered the use of plastic in addition to glass in contact lenses. The 1947 breakthrough made by Kevin Tuohy introduced a comfortable, all-plastic lens that only covered the cornea of the eye, and since that time innovations in design and materials have continued to improve the quality of this important medical device.

She sat in the driver’s seat and waited for the evaluator to get in on the passenger side. Once they were both buckled in, Raquel adjusted the rear view and side view mirrors and took a few deep breaths before starting the engine. Then, after checking for oncoming traffic, Raquel pulled away from the curb and accelerated steadily. She remembered to signal when changing lanes and to maintain a safe distance behind the cars ahead of her. Raquel had never driven through this part of town before, but she was confident in her ability to deal with whatever situation might arise. On her way back, after driving straight for half a mile, Raquel suddenly realized that her left turn indicator was still on. “It’s not the end of the world,” she said to herself as she pulled neatly into the parking space and turned expectantly toward the evaluator.

Which of the following statements does the passage suggest?

A.	Raquel is a safe driver.
B.	Raquel has taken the test before.

Friends who visit my home vary in their experience with wildlife, and I am pleased to share with them my observations and understanding of the many animals I’ve become acquainted with. From rabbits and deer, to hummingbirds and woodpeckers, to bees and spiders, I appreciate all the creatures whose instinctive behaviors and species-specific mannerisms I’ve quietly attended to and learned about. Several friends mistake my familiarity with these neighbors, referring to them as my pets. I gently correct my friends, reminding them that nature alone gives these marvelous, nameless living things their food and shelter, and I remain merely an admiring bystander.

Which of the following best restates the author’s main point?

A.	Animal companions are as delightful as human friends.
B.	Observing animals in nature is preferable to owning pets.
C.	Sharing stories about wildlife is a fun way to entertain friends.

Our forests, with their billions of trees, are the backbone of agriculture, the skeleton of lumbering, and the heart of industry. Even now, in spite of their depletion, they are the cream of our natural resources. They furnish wood for the nation, pasture for thousands of cattle and sheep, and water supply for countless cities and farms. They are the dominions of wildlife. Millions of birds, game animals, and fish live in the forests and the forest streams. The time is coming when our forests will be the greatest playgrounds of America. It is necessary that we preserve, protect, and expand our timberlands. By so doing we shall provide for the needs of future generations.

A.	Forests provide shelter for wildlife.
B.	Forests need to be properly managed.

Avi wanted to build a model volcano, but Seth envisioned a battery powered by a potato. The partners could not agree on how they wanted to complete their project, so they decided to combine their ideas and build a model volcano powered by a potato battery. The project was a huge success and earned them first place at their school science fair and high marks in their science class. After that experience, Avi and Seth collaborated regularly on science projects, and their friendship was sustained by a mutual interest in science. No one was really surprised, therefore, when the two friends completed their degrees and then created a company together, one whose mission is to find solutions to everyday problems by applying scientific principles and knowledge.

The main idea of the passage is that Avi and Seth

Moreover, there are several different types of volunteer opportunities aside from gardening, such as fundraising and community outreach. Additionally, depending on the number of hours worked, volunteers are allowed to take home a portion of the harvest. Finally, volunteering at Our Community Garden is a great way to make new friends who are similarly interested in gardening and promoting community health and wellness.

Legend is not history; but in legend we find embodied historical truths, manners and customs of past ages, beliefs and superstitions otherwise long forgotten, of which history itself takes no account. Legend has preserved for us, maybe in romantic dress, maybe under altered names and circumstances, stirring pictures of heroes and heroines, who once have lived and suffered, fought and conquered, or have faced death with trustful courage; pictures, too, of men of equal prowess, as strong in evil as in might, who, victorious for a time, have yet ever met a stronger power than theirs, stronger in virtue, stronger in might.

The one thing that we do not know—that we feel as if we never could know is the Self in us. Our characters, our powers, our natures, our being—what are they? Our faculties—what can we do? And what can we not do? What is the reason of this faculty, or that want of faculty? We have never reached an understanding of ourselves, which makes us not only know, but perceive what we are capable of knowing; which makes us aware, not only that we can do something, but why we can do it. We are an unknown quantity to ourselves. We can calculate on a given action in a machine, but we cannot calculate on our own, much less on our moods.

Before moving West in the early 1860s, Stetson learned the hat-making trade in his father’s shop in New Jersey. Stetson’s initial design with an unusually wide brim was developed when he needed a hat suited for an expedition in the mountains of Colorado. The hat served Stetson well, and he returned to the East to establish his own hat-making business. It was there that Stetson created the “Boss of the Plains” hat, which became especially popular among cowboys. Its large, flat brim protected wearers from the sun and rain, it was lightweight and waterproof, and the hatband helped secure the hat to the wearer’s head. Over the years, the cowboy hat has evolved to better suit the needs and wants of consumers, including a curved brim that avoids the cattle rancher’s rope, embroidered designs, and pinched crowns (tops) with dented sides. Nevertheless, today’s cowboy hats owe their basic design to Stetson’s “Boss of the Plains” creation.

According to the passage, the original “Boss of the Plains” hat featured

A.	a flat brim.
B.	dented sides.
C.	a pinched crown.

Rather, wolves’ howls are communicative, meaning these animals use their howls as a way to connect with other wolves. Wolves howl for a variety of reasons, including to scare off other wolves from their territory and to rally their pack mates. Due to its low pitch and long duration, a wolf’s howl is audible over long distances, making it an effective way to reach fellow pack members who may be located miles away. Because they are primarily nocturnal, it is true that wolves howl more during nighttime hours; however, they can and do howl during the day on occasion, because the need to communicate with the rest of the pack is crucial to their survival.

According the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Wolves rarely howl at night.
B.	Wolves howl to communicate.
C.	Wolves are compelled to howl.
D.	Wolves howl to express emotion.

To challenge an action taken by an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)—such as denial of a permit to plant crops in a wetland—you may file an appeal with the National Appeals Division (NAD), an independent body within the USDA. The NAD was established in the early 1990s under the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994. This Act merged all USDA agencies that previously provided appellate functions and staffs, and established a single governing body—the NAD—to provide independent hearings and reviews arising from the adverse determinations of several USDA agencies, including the Risk Management Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, or the three Rural Development Agencies. In the event that one of these USDA agencies issues an unfavorable decision to a program beneficiary, the beneficiary can file an appeal with the NAD, and the NAD is responsible for conducting an independent hearing and review of the adverse determination.

Based on the passage, the NAD conducts hearings and reviews of 

A.	unfavorable agency decisions.

As a rule a rock garden should not be near the house; it is something savoring of the wild that does not fit in with most architecture. Exceptions are when the house is on a rocky site that makes such planting desirable, if not imperative, and a slope from the rear or one side of a house that seems decided enough to permit of a sharp break in the general landscape treatment. Save in these circumstances, it is better that it should not be in sight of the house. This is not so hard as it sounds; even on a small place, the spot is easily concealed by a planting of shrubbery.

The small observatory, for such it was, was a circular building with four windows in the walls, and roofed with a wooden dome, so made that it could be shifted round and round by pulling certain cords. One section of this dome was a shutter, which now stood open, and the strip, thus laid bare to the night, was so turned as to face that part of the sky along which the moon was moving. In the center of the room, with its long tube directed towards the opening, stood the largest magic glass, the Telescope, and in the dead stillness of the night, could be heard distinctly the tick-tick of the clockwork, which kept the instrument pointing to the face of the moon, while the room, and all in it, was being carried slowly and steadily onwards by the earth’s rotation on its axis.

Some tips for reducing the chance of an onset of a computer-induced headache include taking regular breaks, ensuring proper lighting, and sitting at least an arm’s length away from the computer monitor. Users should also try adjusting the height of their computer screen so that the center is about four to eight inches below eye-level; this ensures that the neck is not straining upwards to view content on the computer monitor. Comfortable seating also helps reduce the chance of developing a headache, as it reduces muscle tension, specifically in the head, neck, and shoulders.

Their weather-resistant double coat, short stature, agility, and high energy level still make these dogs ideal for shepherding. There are two breeds of Welsh corgis, each named after a town in Wales: the Pembroke and the Cardigan. Although the two breeds are quite similar in terms of looks, the Pembroke is smaller and has pointed rather than rounded ears. Most importantly, because Pembroke Welsh corgis are especially affectionate toward their owners and not too shy with strangers, this breed is a great choice not only for farmers and shepherds but for urban dwellers as well.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

The Forum of Pompeii, as of other ancient cities, was first of all a market place. Early in the morning the country folk gathered here with the products of the farm; here all day long tradespeople of every sort exhibited their wares. In later times the pressure of business led to the erection of separate buildings around the Forum to relieve the congestion; such were the Macellum, used as a provision market; the Eumachia building, erected to accommodate the clothing trade; the Basilica and the market house west of the temple of Jupiter, devoted to other branches of trade.

The season started out with an on-campus jamboree during which, over the course of a single day, every team in the district played multiple short games. Then, the real competitive games began. The first game was memorable because Dion’s team, the Firebirds, defeated the league’s best team, the Jaguars. The third game was momentous due to the fact that it was the first game played at night under lights.

The lower portion of this distance gives some very beautiful views of valley and ocean, and as the route enters the canyon it winds in and out following the devious course of the sparkling little stream which leaps over the rocks, now crossing smaller canyons on substantial bridges, and then cutting through solid rock, making a picturesque road which, were it not overshadowed by the greater glories of the upper portion, would of itself be famous. At Rubio canyon the foot of the Great Cable Incline is reached at an altitude of 2,200 feet above the sea.

Based on the passage, where does the route travel immediately after leaving Altadena?

A.	through solid rock
B.	over the high mesa
C.	across small canyons
D.	along the little stream

Earlier today, I was struck yet again by the question that many consumers face while shopping for barbecue supplies at the grocery store—why do so many companies sell hot dogs in packages of ten, when hot dog buns are most often available in packs of eight? Is it a clever way to trick consumers into buying more of each? Do very many people eat hot dogs without the bun? To purchase an equal number of hot dogs and buns, the least one would have to buy would be a whopping four packages of hot dogs and five packages of buns. I realize that this minor discrepancy doesn’t bother some people, but I am willing to buy exclusively from any grocery store that sells hot dogs and buns packaged in equal numbers.

The ambient light was quickly diminishing, and familiar objects like the old farm tools leaning against the building began to take on a sinister quality. When I turned to reach for my data collection form, a flash of bright light from the woods behind our position caught my eye. I nudged Sergio to get his attention, and we both watched as the light flashed again and again. Perhaps this was a signal, but for whom was it intended? Was someone trying to communicate with us?

I was desperate for sun to lighten my cheerless apartment and allow me to turn my space heater down, but my misery had to be faced.

The great bell of Beaulieu was ringing. Far away through the forest might be heard its musical clangor and swell. Peat-cutters on Blackdown and fishers upon the Exe heard the distant throbbing rising and falling upon the sultry summer air. It was a common sound in those parts—as common as the chatter of the jays and the booming of the bittern. Yet the fishers and the peasants raised their heads and looked questions at each other, for the angelus had already gone and vespers was still far off.

She was primarily attracted to painting because she wanted to escape to another world and forget about her busy routine for a little while. She wasn’t thinking about selling her paintings, at least not right away. She just wanted to paint for her own enjoyment. Kimi liked the idea of spending time outdoors depicting desert landscapes, and she lived in the perfect place for that: New Mexico. In addition, Kimi had always been interested in color, and she welcomed the opportunity to experiment with a range of different hues. Fortunately, there was an established community of amateur painters in Kimi’s town, which would give her the opportunity to make new friends with similar interests. After enrolling in a painting class, Kimi felt a new sense of purpose. After all, Georgia O’Keeffe was once a beginner too.

Tracking down a bakery was easy, but Mara had to work hard to persuade the owner to deliver to Saul’s workplace because it was somewhat remote.

Apparently many other nature lovers had the same idea, and there was only a single space left for one of our cars. Then I noticed that someone had inconsiderately parked a vehicle so that it took up two spaces, and the driver of that car was nowhere to be seen.

Although adult males are somewhat larger than adult females, most people find size to be a difficult field mark because it is rare to spot the two sexes side by side. In addition, an adolescent male and an adult female are often very similar in size. One of the more reliable ways to tell males from females is to study their horns. A female mountain goat’s horns are thin and straight for much of their length with a sharp curve near the tip of the horn; whereas, the male’s horns are thicker and have a much more gradual curve. Also, the bases of the female’s horns are smaller and are set farther apart than those of the male. Males and females of the same age have horns that are very similar in length, so horn length is not a useful way to distinguish between the sexes. 

According to the passage, compared to a male mountain goat’s horns, the female’s horns

A.	have larger bases.

Certain facts about Shakespeare’s life, including his exact birthdate, education, and how he spent certain periods of his life, are largely unknown. Historians have speculated about his life based on clues pertaining to the writer’s publications and public records. For example, historians believe that Shakespeare’s father was a prominent civil servant in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, and, based on this information, have deduced that his son likely attended a nearby grammar school. It is known that William married in 1582 and that he and his wife had a daughter followed by twins. However, shortly after the birth of the twins, there is no record of his activity for several years—that is, until 1592 when a well-known author criticizes Shakespeare in a publication.

Coral polyps are related to anemones and jellyfish, and are small, translucent organisms with soft bodies that are protected by a limestone exoskeleton. Individual polyps form reefs when they attach to rocks on the sea floor and create thousands of clones that connect together in colonies. Coral polyps have several interesting ways to obtain food. Most corals have an interdependent relationship with a type of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae that live within their tissues. The zooxanthellae share the sugars that they produce through photosynthesis with their coral hosts in exchange for protection. In addition, some corals feed at night by extending tentacles made up of specialized stinging cells, called nematocysts, to catch any small fish or tiny floating organisms called zooplankton that happen to get too close.

At the time, Russia had several reasons for selling this vast acreage. First, Russia was in debt due to the financially disastrous Crimean War of the 1850s and lacked the funds needed to develop and defend its North American territory. Additionally, the Russian settlers in Alaska numbered only about four hundred, making the land difficult to protect from hostile forces. Moreover, Russia was more interested in supporting its newfound interest in Asian expansion. As a result, the United States acquired the land for about $7.2 million, or approximately two cents per acre. Secretary of State William Seward was severely criticized for agreeing to purchase this largely unexplored land that many considered useless. However, all was forgiven when gold was discovered in Alaska in 1896.

In 1858 Sir William Herschel, a British magistrate in India, required fingerprints on contracts as a method of signature to make them more official and binding and to help prevent fraud. Then, in 1880, Dr. Henry Faulds, a Scottish doctor, published his studies of fingerprints and included his ideas for how they could be used to apprehend criminals. Faulds is often credited with the first fingerprint match of a print left on a bottle. However, it was the anthropologist Sir Francis Galton—a cousin of Charles Darwin—who collected 8,000 sets of fingerprints and used scientific methods to statistically prove their uniqueness. Galton published the first practical fingerprint classification scheme in his 1892 book, aptly titled Finger Prints.

There are many different types of fire extinguishers, but almost all of these devices are used to avert large-scale emergency fire situations. To operate a fire extinguisher, begin by pulling the pin near the top of the canister. Next, aim the device toward the base of the fire rather than at the flames themselves. Then, squeeze the top lever on the extinguisher, which will emit the pressurized chemical agent to suppress the fire. Sweep the nozzle of the extinguisher from side to side until the fire is suppressed, and then slowly back away while watching for hot spots. Of course, after using a fire extinguisher, the device must be recharged, unless it is a disposable device, in which case it can be thrown away. Following these steps will help ensure the proper functioning of typical fire extinguishers.

It was 9:30 in the morning, which meant that the first assignment of the term was due in thirty minutes. He printed the document that he had been editing, dressed quickly, and hastily raced out the door. Because he didn’t have a car or bike to get to the other side of campus, he had to walk as fast as he could. Kai moved quickly—past the library, dining hall, and quad—and finally arrived at the humanities building. It was 9:58 when he sat down in a seat at the back of the classroom and realized that he had left his essay back at the dorm, something he had never done before. After class, Kai waited until the professor was free and calmly explained what had happened. Kai avoided, as he usually does, any fabrications or excuses. His teacher smiled and told him not to worry—the essay wasn’t due until next week.

Which of the following statements about Kai does the passage suggest?

A.	He is physically fit.
B.	He is a truthful person.
C.	He is an anxious person.
D.	He is habitually forgetful.

The animal plankton comprises a mass of microscopic creatures belonging to the Protozoa, Radiolaria, and Globeriginae phyla. There are also immense numbers of tiny, invisible crustaceans like the Copepoda, and eggs and spores of all kinds of fish and algae. These organisms are so dense in certain sea areas that their particular colorations are reflected in the water. The Red Sea, for example, is colored by a reddish algae; the Baltic and ocean areas near Greenland are colored green by swarms of algae, and certain tropical seas are often brilliantly colored in the same manner.

Which of the following best summarizes the passage?

A.	There are many different types of microscopic organisms.
B.	Crustaceans like the Copepoda are invisible to human beings.

It is possible within the limits of this paper simply to touch upon the chief events and experiences in Lincoln’s life. It has been my endeavor to select those that were the most important in the forming or in the expression of his character. The term “forming” is, however, not adequate to indicate the development of a personality like Lincoln’s. We rather think of his sturdy character as having been forged into its final form through the fiery furnace of fierce struggle, as hammered out under the blows of difficulties and disasters, and as pressed beneath the weight of the nation’s burdens, until was at last produced the finely tempered nature of the man we know, the Lincoln of history, that exquisite combination of sweetness of nature and strength of character.

Which of the following statements best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	Lincoln possessed numerous admirable qualities.
B.	Lincoln faced many hardships during his presidency.
C.	Lincoln’s formative years in office defined him as a president.
D.	Lincoln’s character was influenced by his challenging experiences.

What was the attraction in going to an outlandish place so many miles away? The answer to the question was contained in its own words. Precisely because it was an outlandish place and so far away, I chose it. Palled for the moment with civilization and its surroundings, I wanted to escape somewhere, where I might be as far removed from them as possible. Many of my readers have doubtless felt the dissatisfaction with oneself, and everybody else, that comes over one at times in the midst of the pleasures of life; when one wearies of the shallow artificiality of modern existence; when what was once excitement has become so no longer, and a longing grows up within one to taste a more vigorous emotion than that afforded by the monotonous round of society’s so-called “pleasures.”

Which of the following best restates the author’s main point?

A.	Traveling to a remote destination is renewing.
B.	Many fashionable delights soon lose their appeal.
C.	Many people have experienced feelings of restlessness.
D.	Traveling offers a much-needed break from the work routine.

Positive thinking is an important aspect of effective stress management, and studies suggest that being optimistic may result in several health benefits, such as a stronger immune response and lower rates of depression. To better cope with unpleasant events, try altering your perspective by viewing the situation in a more objective manner. Additionally, consider what misconceptions might make you perceive an event or experience in a negative way, and be aware that it’s possible that you may not have all of the information about a given situation. Using these techniques may help you begin to think more positively and live a healthier, more fulfilling life.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	provide an example of a stressful situation.

Furthermore, sometimes it is easy to procrastinate in the presence of certain distractions, such as television programs, favorite pastimes, or friends. Determining the underlying reason for procrastination can help people lead more productive lives.

A signal for this purpose should be distinctive and of the most substantial character. A fixed signal manipulated from within the office is greatly to be preferred. Several such have been devised. The signal should be such as to be distinctly seen at proper distances; it should be as little as possible liable to confusion with other objects, and it should be an adornment rather than a disfigurement to the landscape in which it forms a prominent feature. The most satisfactory signal within the author’s knowledge is the simple semaphore arm, extending horizontally from a post and showing a red light to signify “stop,” and inclined and showing a white light to signify the opposite, and operated by a handle within the telegraph office.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	illustrate how to manipulate a train signal.

Right after his grandparents got married, they inherited the property and built the modest house themselves—over many weekends—because they wanted the security of having an affordable place of their own to live in, rather than relying on the rental market. Some years later, after they had moved back to the city, the house served as a romantic weekend retreat where they could escape from their busy urban lives. But as the years passed and Jon’s mother was born and another bedroom was added, the beach house became a gathering place for the entire extended family. In the summertime, it was not unusual to have three generations under one roof. This summer would bring a big change. Jon’s parents had decided to tear down the old cottage and build their retirement home in its place.

The benefits of this arrangement are that he doesn’t get lonely and I have someone to keep me company. However, Charlie is very protective of me, and he believes that our territory extends far beyond the confines of the house and the front and back yards. On the days that I’m home, he feels compelled to bark at every car, pedestrian, and dog who passes by and at every noise he hears, just to let me know that he is doing his job. He makes his presence known with his deep, hoarse bark that is difficult to ignore during an important business call. Though my neighbors are affectionate toward Charlie, they like to point out that he is much quieter on the days when I’m not around. I love Charlie despite his propensity to bark, and I enjoy the time we spend together, but comments like these make going back into the office appealing.

There, she found mounds of fresh ginger, a huge variety of peppers, and precious fresh wasabi. Ame caught a whiff of fresh flowers and, after asking for directions, she found the flower section right around the corner. Even though there were many exotic blossoms to choose from, she quickly settled on the more familiar Gerbera daisies. On her way out, Ame stopped at a booth that sold specialty teas and purchased a green tea blend with delicate jasmine notes that reminded her of the tea that her mother prepared for her when she was a child.

The best method of artificially lighting a dining room is hard to decide. Nothing is prettier or pleasanter than candlelight, and it is preferable to gas or lamps in that it does not heat a room perceptibly. But candles are expensive, if enough are used to produce a respectable illumination, and nothing is more dismal than eating by a dim light. Good candles are costly, and cheap ones not only give a poor light, but drip and smoke and smell, and are otherwise intolerable. A new style of candle has recently been introduced which is pierced through its length with three holes. These tiny pipes are supposed to carry off the melted wax, and their advocates claim that these candles will not drip on the outside.

For example, bananas are rich in potassium—about four hundred milligrams per medium-sized banana—which is an essential mineral for maintaining healthy blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Bananas may also help lower cholesterol levels because they contain sterols, which are substances that can block the absorption of cholesterol. In addition, bananas are packed full of certain carbohydrates, such as soluble and insoluble fiber, that regulate the speed of digestion. Finally, bananas’ fructooligosaccharides—unique fructose-containing carbohydrates—are metabolized in the lower intestine and help maintain the balance of good bacteria in the digestive tract. So, the next time hunger strikes, reach for a banana.

I’ve learned that an insect hotel made with a variety of materials can provide invertebrates with a welcome place to take cover during the cold winter months, to nest during the spring and summer, or to stay dry during the rainy season. Hollow plant stems or small holes drilled into dry wood are ideal nesting sites for solitary bees and wasps, whereas stag beetles are attracted to damp, rotting logs. Stacks of dry leaves and small sticks provide a welcome hibernation spot for ladybugs, and a rolled-up piece of cardboard placed inside an open-ended tin or plastic container creates a snug abode for lacewings.

The Carolina poplar is commonly planted in cities because it grows rapidly and is able to withstand the smoke and drought conditions of the city. Where other trees, however, can be substituted with success, the poplar should be avoided. It’s very fast growth is really a point against the tree, because it grows so fast that it becomes too tall for surrounding property, and its wood being extremely soft and brittle, the tree frequently breaks in windstorms. In many cases it is entirely uprooted, because it is not a deep-rooted tree. Its larger roots, which spread near the surface, upset the sidewalk or prevent the growth of other vegetation on the lawn, while its finer rootlets, in their eager search for moisture, penetrate and clog the joints of neighboring water and sewer pipes.

Based on the passage, the Carolina poplar tree is often planted in cities because it

On her way home, she remembered that she needed a card and some wrapping paper, so she swung by the pharmacy. As soon as she got home, Stacia wrapped the present, decorated the house, and laid the food and beverages out on the dining table. Stacia then began welcoming the guests as they arrived. When Stacia’s daughter walked in right on time, the partygoers jumped out of their hiding places and greeted the birthday girl with a loud, “Surprise!”

Based on the passage, where did Stacia go immediately before buying refreshments?

The plane trip was very long, but there were several other English-speaking passengers, some of whom were also from Ohio, so we all enjoyed chatting about our hometowns in the Midwest. Although it was difficult to say goodbye, I am very thankful for having had the opportunity to learn about your nation’s history and culture. It was such a delight to stay with you and your family, and I thank you sincerely for your gracious hospitality and support over the last few months. I am certain that all you taught me about the Spanish language will be of great use to me this summer. I hope to see you all again, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Unlike last year, the children I now work with are typically between the ages of six and eight, so I have had to adjust to a different curriculum. Of course, I am using different textbooks targeted to the appropriate grade level, and I now dedicate additional time to teaching more basic vocabulary. I have incorporated shorter, more hands-on instructional activities and small group exercises. In addition, I have adapted some lessons on my favorite topics to a lower reading level. Moreover, several of my students have recently transferred here from schools outside the district, so it is crucial that I evaluate their knowledge and skills to determine where they stand in relation to our district’s standards. Ultimately, I have had to substantially revise my approach to teaching to meet the demands of this new position.

Which of the following statements does the passage suggest?

A.	The author is now teaching reading.
B.	The author formerly taught older students.
C.	The author was transferred to a new school.

A pair of sparrows nest regularly in an eaves-trough, so close to the roof that I can overhear their family talk. Round, loquacious, familiar Cock Sparrow is a family man—so entirely a family man as to be nothing else at all. He is a success, too. It does me good to see him build. He tore the old nest all away in the early winter, so as to be ready. There came a warm springish day in February, and he began. A blizzard stopped him, but with the melting of the snow he went to work again, completing the nest by the middle of March.

The passage suggests that the male sparrow

A.	chose a poor spot to build the nest.
B.	was determined to finish building the nest.

His original owners had relocated out of the country and taken the mama cat along, but they had been unable to find homes for the kittens. The kittens were well cared for at the shelter until they reached adoption age. Thankfully, I visited the animal shelter just a few days after Felix was available for adoption. After making my decision, I had to fill out some paperwork, present a letter proving pets were allowed at my apartment complex, and show my photo identification as proof that I was at least 18 years of age. Then, I simply paid a fee and was able to take Felix home with me that very same day. At first, I felt bad about separating him from his littermates, but I later learned they had been adopted, too. 

In discussing Felix, the author’s primary focus is on the kitten’s

The number of raw materials, both natural and artificial, at the disposal of the perfumer, has increased so enormously during recent years that the scenting of soaps has now become an art requiring very considerable skill, and a thorough knowledge of the products to be handled. Not only does the all-important question of odor come into consideration, but the action of the perfumes on the soap, and on each other, has also to be taken into account. Thus, many essential oils and synthetic perfumes cause the soap to darken rapidly on keeping, e.g., clove oil, cassia oil, heliotropin, vanillin. Further, some odoriferous substances, from their chemical nature, are incompatible with soap, and soon decompose any soap to which they are added, while in a few cases, the blending of two unsuitable perfumes results, by mutual reaction, in the effect of each being lost.

In discussing the scenting of soaps, the author’s primary focus is on the

A.	large variety of possible scents. 
B.	introduction of artificial scenting materials.
C.	need to carefully choose the scenting ingredients.
D.	negative consequences of some scenting substances.

Mangoes, which have been grown in my home state of Florida since the early 1800s, have been cultivated in India for over 4,000 years. Native to tropical and subtropical climates, mangoes cannot tolerate cold temperatures. If temperatures drop below 40°F, the fruit and flowers on the tree can be damaged, and if temperatures drop much below 25°F, even for a short period of time, the trees themselves can be seriously injured. In addition to warmth, most mango trees must have relatively dry weather during the time period when they will bear fruit. Surprisingly, mango trees can live to be over 300 years old. Though I have always enjoyed mangoes, I now understand more about what they require for successful growth, and appreciate this juicy, peach-like fruit even more.

In discussing mangoes, the author’s primary focus is on the

A.	climate requirements of mango trees.
B.	distinctive taste of mangoes.

The two hotel structures seemed to lean toward him, competing with each other for attention and power. Everywhere he turned, the effect was the same. The high-rise apartment building on the corner shot up into the sky like a rocket headed for the cosmos, and the spires on top of the business tower next door almost punctured the clouds floating overhead. However, the most ambitious building on the block, by far, was the formidable bank building, which seemed to stare back at him with a hundred accusing steel-and-glass eyes.

Let us now take a brief survey of some of the theories which have been put forth regarding the nature of the spots on the Sun. In the early days of the telescope, that is to say, during the 17th century, two general ideas were current. Some thought the spots to be shapeless satellites revolving round the Sun; others that they were clouds, or aggregations of smoke, floating about in a solar atmosphere. Scheiner, the author of the first theory, abandoned it towards the close of his life, having arrived at the conclusion that the spots were situated below the general level of the Sun’s surface. Another idea, but of later date, was that the Sun is a liquid and incandescent mass of matter, and the spots immense fragments of Scoriae, or clinkers, floating upon an ocean of fire.

Based on the passage, Scheiner initially thought that sunspots were

A.	objects orbiting around the Sun.

It also kept three extra team members on the roster, ensuring the team always had substitutes if the starters became tired. The opponent, the team from Des Moines, was at a disadvantage with only one substitute player on the bench. Also, the Des Moines team had less experience than the home team. However, in preparation for the game, the Des Moines team had studied the plays the Cedar Rapids team used that season, and the coach felt confident in the team’s abilities. After all, the Des Moines team was only a few wins away from competing in the state tournament. In addition, the away team had an advantage that the home team lacked: four days of rest since their last game.

Leis are garlands that are most often woven with flowers, but they can also be made of leaves, shells, seeds, nuts, or feathers. Visitors to Hawai’i are often presented with a flower lei upon their arrival. Although some visitors wear their leis snug around the neck, coiled on top of the head, or wrapped around the wrist, the correct way to wear a lei is to drape it over the shoulders so that it hangs down both in front and in back. Leis are considered tokens of affection, and they come with their own set of cultural expectations. For example, people should never refuse a lei if one is presented to them, and it is considered rude for the receiver to remove a lei in the presence of the giver. Thus, recipients who are sensitive to flowers should take care to discreetly remove the lei and offer it to some other lucky person.

As it cools, the liquid contents inside contract, and the inner shell membrane separates from the outer shell membrane. When this occurs, an air cell forms within the egg. Because eggshells are porous, the size of the air cell increases over time, and this makes the egg more buoyant. For this reason, one can determine an egg’s freshness by submerging it in a pot of cold water. If the egg sinks and lies on its side at the bottom of the pot, it is just one to two days old. If it touches the bottom, but angles upward, it is about seven days old. At about fourteen days old, the egg will rise up from the bottom, but will remain submerged. However, if the egg floats on the water’s surface, it’s at least four to five weeks old and should be discarded. The size of the air cell is the key to this straightforward test. 

According to the passage, if the submerged egg touches the bottom, but angles upward, the egg is

A.	only a couple of days old.
B.	just about one week old.
C.	around two weeks old.
D.	a month or more old.

2568.	Until the invention of the steel pen point during the nineteenth century, quill pens served as a popular writing instrument. They were made from the flight feathers of various kinds of birds. Crow feathers were useful for making fine lines, while swan or goose feathers were commonly used for ordinary script. Most quills were made from the feathers of a bird’s left wing because they pointed outward and away from right-handed writers. To craft a quill pen, several angled cuts were made in the base of the feather, a slit was made in the hollow end, and the corners on either side of the slit were trimmed to create a sharp point. These alterations allowed for better control of the flow of ink, and the shape of the cuts impacted the appearance of the script. The basic design of these early pens carried over to the steel fountain pens that emerged later. While quill pens are rarely used as everyday writing utensils in modern times, enthusiasts and collectors still enjoy repairing, using, and preserving these antique instruments.

In discussing quill pens, the author’s primary focus is on the writing implement’s

A.	origin.

All orchids need the right amount of light, and most varieties do well when kept indoors and placed near a window where they receive bright but filtered sunlight. Healthy orchids that receive adequate light typically have light to medium green leaves. In contrast, dark green leaves indicate that the plant is not receiving enough light to flower. Generally, orchids prefer medium to high humidity levels and warm temperatures. However, when temperatures are cooler, the humidity level should be reduced and vice versa. Finally, orchids should be watered only about once per week. To mimic what they receive in the wild, water orchids with tepid rainwater, if possible. Any excess water that collects under the pot should be drained. Orchids that receive proper care will re-flower and enliven their surroundings for many years with their exotic blooms.

In discussing orchids, the author’s primary focus is on the plants’

A.	exotic varieties.
B.	aesthetic appeal.

Seapoint was beautifully situated on a headland, which commanded a view of the boundless sea on one side, and on the other a panoramic view of the fertile Isle of Wight. And this was the summer home of the artist's little daughter. Her governess, Miss Mortimer, had charge of her, but her father came backwards and forwards to see her constantly; for Lilian was all that was now left to him in this world to love except his art, and the days when he came were the brightest of his little girl’s life. She knew that he would take her on long rambling walks, and let her clamber about amongst the rocks and little bays and creeks in which she delighted; and that, when she was tired, there was always a comfortable resting-place ready for her in that father's arms; and loving, tender words, which she never heard from anyone but him.

Yet, unless this story is written now, I know I shall never have the courage to tell the truth about the matter—not from fear of ridicule, but because I myself shall soon cease to credit what I now know to be true.

The island lay on the tranquil river like a splendid green enamel on blue porcelain. Its level, at this season, lay several feet above that of the water, and its shores, fantastically looped with little, sweeping coves and jutting points, were fringed with deep rushes of intense, glaucous green. Whenever the wind puffed lightly over them, the tops of the rushes bowed gravely together in long ranks, and turned silvery gray. Here and there above them fluttered a snipe, signaling its hidden young, then winging off across the water to the next point, with a clear, two-noted whistle.

The patient shadow on the antique sundial wound its way imperceptibly from left to right, and long slanting threads of light and shadow pierced in time between the branches of the poplars.

Named in honor of a particular U.S. president, one federal holiday is now commonly known as “President’s Day” and is celebrated on the third Monday of February; however, it did not start out that way. This federal holiday initially celebrated only the birth of George Washington, and it was held every year on Washington’s actual day of birth: February 22. The change of the holiday’s date of observance to a specific Monday occurred after the passage of the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill in 1968. This bill, which also affected the observances of Memorial Day and Veterans Day, aimed to create more three-day weekends for families and to reduce interruptions to business and manufacturing during the workweek. While there was argument against the bill, businesses primarily supported the bill for its anticipated economic benefits. Although the holiday’s date of observance changed with the passing of the bill, its official name remains “Washington’s Birthday,” encouraging new generations of citizens to remember the nation’s first president.

According to the passage, the federal holiday celebrating George Washington was

A.	established by a bill passed in 1968.

Although a series of factors led to the Boston Tea Party, it was the Tea Act passed by British Parliament on May 10, 1773, that caused outraged American colonists to dump more than ninety thousand pounds of British tea into the Boston Harbor in December of that year. The Tea Act gave British merchants exclusive rights to tea sales in the American colonies, which greatly angered colonists already piqued by Britain’s attempts to raise revenue at their expense. The British Parliament had already levied taxes on the colonies through the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Act of 1767. Although the Stamp Act was soon repealed and the Townshend Act was partially repealed, Parliament retained the Townshend Act’s tax on tea to uphold its authority to tax the colonies. The American colonists strongly resented being taxed, especially when they were not represented in the British Parliament. In response to the Boston Tea Party, the British Parliament enacted a series of harsher measures, which eventually culminated in the American Revolution.

Based on the passage, Parliament retained the Townshend Act’s tax on tea to

A.	recover losses from the destruction of British goods.

Initially, these machines relied on a variety of methods to deliver cash, such as dispensing bills in plastic cartridges and in fixed amounts. Before the advent of ATM cards, physical tokens were used to gain access to an account. However, tokens presented security issues because there was no way to verify the identity of the user. In addition, early ATMs often broke down or ran out of cash. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the machines fulfilled a need, especially for working people with hours different than those of banks, which opened late and closed early. Moreover, banks benefited because they were able to decrease overcrowding in branches, defer or eliminate the need to open new branches, and reduce labor costs. Though many consumers were at first skeptical of the ATM, the machines gained momentum during the late 1970s and are commonplace now.

Based on the passage, people tolerated the early ATMs because the machines were

This event can be traced back to the late 1960s when former Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson proposed setting aside a day each year to honor the Earth as a way of raising the nation’s environmental consciousness in the hopes of eventually creating a nationwide movement. Nelson’s idea was influenced by Vietnam antiwar protests organized on college campuses across the nation. His plan came to fruition on April 22, 1970, when approximately twenty million people across the United States rallied together to discuss pollution and defensive strategies to protect the planet. This first Earth Day eventually helped lead to the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts, as well as the establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Earth Day is an event that continues to provide a platform for discussing environmental issues that impact all of Earth’s inhabitants.

As the morning wears on and the sun rises, it is a pretty scene. The great blue restless ocean, with its mighty Atlantic swell, lashing itself in spray and foam, with a long white line breaking and disappearing, re-appearing and dying against the bleak rock-bound coast. Sometimes the cliffs are formed of strata of grey lava or limestone, at others they are of rich red sandstone, colors that are intensified with the peculiar clearness of the atmosphere. Above all, there is a pure blue sky, with white clouds chasing each other and casting shadows along the coast. Now and again we pass large fishing luggers sailing swiftly by in the brisk breeze. Some have tawny orange or deep brown sails, others pure white ones, looking like wings spread in the sunlight, gliding swiftly and silently past. It is a rich bit of coloring to eyes tired and sad with the monotony of an impenetrable, all-surrounding line of sky and ocean.

The transition to industry and manufacturing first began in Britain during the 1700s and eventually spread throughout Europe and to the United States. Prior to this time period, goods were handmade using basic tools and machines. During the Industrial Revolution, mass production in factories largely replaced home manufacturing, and such transformations significantly changed people’s livelihoods. Some changes culminated in an improved standard of living as well as a greater variety and number of goods, but other changes caused lower wages, dangerous working conditions, job loss, and pollution. Although the negative aspects seem to outweigh the positive ones, without a doubt, the Industrial Revolution was a major turning point in history.

There was a rosy Swedish girl sitting on the floor of a shop window opposite and washing the glass. She had moved the fresh vegetables aside and planted herself in the midst of them. There she sat among the cabbages and turnips and other sweet things just out of the earth; piles of delicate green lettuce buds, golden carrots bursting into feathery tops, ruddy beets, and pink-checked. It was pretty to see the honest joy of her work and the interest of her parted lips, when, after polishing the glass, it shone as crystal clear as her own eyes.

A number of the old-school naturalists believed that when an animal’s coloring assumed the snowy-white coat of its arctic surroundings, this was due to the natural tendency on the part of its hair and fur to assume the colorings and tints of their habitat. This, however, is absolutely false; and no better proof of it can be offered than the case of the arctic musk-ox, who is far more polar in his haunts than even the polar bear, and is therefore exposed to the whitening influence of the wintry regions more than the bear. Yet he never turns white, but is always brown. The only enemy of this northern-dweller is the arctic wolf, and against this enemy he is protected by powerful hoofs, thick hair, and immense horns. He does not need to conceal himself, and therefore does not simulate the color of his surroundings.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	make an argument.
B.	give an example.

That night, after they reached the hut, snow fell; and fell for very many days after that, so that the paths and the divisions in the fields were all obliterated, and all the smaller streams were frozen over, and the cold was intense upon the plains. Then, indeed, it became hard work to go round for the milk while the world was all dark, and carry it through the darkness to the silent town. Hard work, especially for Patrasche, for the passage of the years, that were only bringing Nello a stronger youth, were bringing him old age, and his joints were stiff and his bones ached often. But he would never give up his share of the labor. Nello would fain have spared him and drawn the cart himself, but Patrasche would not allow it.

The spring was a hidden thing. You might have passed within ten feet of it and never have suspected its existence. Two generations past a huge old pine had fallen almost across it. Nothing was left of the tree but its crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly, making a green roof and a lacy screen for the water. A maple-tree grew beside it with a curiously gnarled and twisted trunk, creeping along the ground for a little way before shooting up into the air, and so forming a quaint seat; and September had flung a scarf of pale smoke-blue asters around the hollow.

Never had the Maypole been so gayly decked as at sunset on midsummer eve. This venerated emblem was a pine-tree, which had preserved the slender grace of youth, while it equaled the loftiest height of the old wood monarchs. From its top streamed a silken banner, colored like the rainbow. Down nearly to the ground the pole was dressed with birchen boughs, and others of the liveliest green, and some with silvery leaves, fastened by ribbons that fluttered in fantastic knots of twenty different colors, but no sad ones. Garden flowers, and blossoms of the wilderness, laughed gladly forth amid the verdure, so fresh and dewy that they must have grown by magic on that happy pine-tree.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), organic agriculture produces food or other products using methods that preserve the environment and avoid the use of most synthetic materials, such as pesticides and antibiotics. Organic farmers, ranchers, and food processors must follow a defined set of standards to produce organic food and fiber that can be labeled USDA organic. Development of the standards is the responsibility of the USDA National Organic Program (NOP), which is based on the general principles described by Congress in the Organic Foods Production Act. Moreover, there is a National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) consisting of citizens and members of the organic community who are appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. The NOSB meets regularly to receive public testimony and advise the USDA on the organic standards. All specific organic standards are in the USDA Organic Regulations. The NOP also maintains a handbook that communicates the organic standards.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the range and pasture lands of the United States are diverse types of land where the primary vegetation produced is herbaceous plants and shrubs. These lands provide forage for beef cattle, dairy cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and other types of domestic livestock. Also, many species of wildlife, ranging from big game to nesting songbirds, depend on these lands for food and cover. Although primary economic outputs include livestock production, wildlife values are also a major economic consideration for these lands, especially the range lands. The environmental values of these lands are extensive and provide many essential ecosystem services, such as clean water, wildlife and fish habitat, as well as recreational opportunities. Furthermore, the scenic, cultural, and historic value of these lands provide enriching experiences, as well as economic benefits.

2602.	Contrary to popular belief, what some people call the “funny bone” isn’t a bone at all--it’s actually a nerve called the ulnar nerve. The nerve roots that form the ulnar nerve exit from the spinal cord between the vertebrae in the neck, run through the shoulder, down the inside part of the arm and elbow, and into the hand. The ulnar nerve controls several hand and forearm movements and communicates sensations in the pinky and ring fingers to the brain. The uncomfortable feeling people get when hitting the funny bone in their elbow usually happens when the ulnar nerve bumps against the humerus, which is the long bone that extends from the shoulder to the elbow. Most nerves are well protected by muscle or bone, but the ulnar nerve is not. In fact, in some areas, the ulnar nerve is close to the surface of the skin, making it vulnerable. While injuries to the ulnar nerve can occur, hitting your funny bone typically doesn’t cause great harm or pain--just a funny feeling that lasts a few seconds.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct? 

A.	The funny bone is a nickname for the humerus.
B.	The ulnar nerve is well protected from serious injury.
C.	The funny bone extends from the shoulder to the elbow.

Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him.

Construction of the building, then known as the “New War Department Building in Arlington,” began in September 1941. Despite its massive size, the building was completed just seventeen months later, and by then, people had already started calling it “the pentagonal building.” On February 19, 1943, the building was officially renamed “The Pentagon.” While the shape would later become a symbol of American military power, the innovative design was mainly a result of spatial constraints. The original proposed site of the Pentagon was a plot of land with five sides bound by roads, trees, and railroad tracks. In response to criticism, President Roosevelt ordered the project to be built in a new location. While the new site allowed for the construction of a differently shaped building, the architects, increasingly concerned about the schedule, maintained their original design. Today, the unique building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

John Muir is one such example. The Scottish-American naturalist and wilderness preservation advocate was in California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains in 1874 when a strong windstorm developed. Rather than take cover, Muir climbed a 100-foot-tall tree to experience what the trees felt during a storm. He clung to the swaying tree for hours as the storm swept through and later wrote that he had never before enjoyed “so noble an exhilaration of motion.” As another example, meteorologists, during contemporary storms, chase weather systems from the ground to collect data and record observations to learn more about how storms form and to develop more accurate warning systems.

No birth record exists, but other public records document several key events in his life. In 1582, Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, and the couple had three children—Susanna, born in 1583, and Hamnet and Judith, twins born in 1585. After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare vanishes from public record for seven years, a period some refer to as the “lost years.” Some speculate that he went into hiding after poaching game, while others say he worked as an assistant schoolmaster or even as a horse attendant for theater patrons during that time. However, it is known that Shakespeare was living in London in the early 1590s and became a managing partner of an acting company by 1594. By 1597, nearly half of his plays were published. His most famous works were published between 1600 and 1608. Finally, records show that Shakespeare was buried in 1616.

For centuries, punctuation has been used to help clarify meaning. While the use of punctuation will likely always be important for most types of writing, some of today’s popular modes of communication emphasize speed and brevity over proper punctuation. In text messages, for example, many people consistently avoid using periods, which can be interpreted as too formal; however, people use exclamation points and question marks freely to convey their mood or emotion. Just as in a casual conversation, using formal language in a text message may send the wrong message. Therefore, knowledge of punctuation is important, but this knowledge should also include understanding when—and when not—to use it.

A.	It is best to avoid using punctuation in text messages.

The trail was over 2,000 miles long, beginning in Missouri and ending in the Willamette Valley in Oregon, crossing the Great Plains and the formidable Rocky Mountains along the way. Between 1840 and 1860, during the trail’s peak years, more than 400,000 pioneers traveled the route, enduring hardships such as disease, accidents, and harsh weather. On their journey across the open plains, travelers often spread out from the main trail in an effort to access better grazing land for their animals and hunt for wild game, as well as to avoid the clouds of dust stirred up by other wagon trains. As time went on, settlers seeking to make the trip faster forged new routes. Only a fraction of the travelers actually ended their trek in Oregon; many people put down roots in Wyoming or Idaho or branched off the Oregon Trail to other routes leading to California, Utah, and Montana.

In 1593, Turkey introduced tulips to Holland, and the flower quickly became a status symbol when wealthy collectors started competing for the rarest specimens. The unique-looking flowers were always expensive, but the price jumped substantially when some tulips contracted a virus that caused colorful streaks to appear on the petals, making them even more desirable. Soon, many people started to invest wildly in tulip bulbs, hoarding them and taking a risk that prices would keep increasing. However, the pricing bubble burst as cautious investors started selling their bulbs. This created a ripple effect as more and more investors tried to sell, and the prices started falling. The government tried to stop the plummeting prices by honoring contracts at a fraction of their face value, but the damage was irreparable, and the tulip craze came to an abrupt end.

He was soon entertaining himself and his friends by conducting his own experiments, including one involving the density of the water supply in Rome, Italy. Fermi became so knowledgeable that his college entry essay advanced him to the doctoral program. In 1926, Fermi became a theoretical physics professor at a university, but it was after he emigrated to the United States that Fermi achieved a groundbreaking accomplishment. Fermi realized that neutrons emitted during the splitting of uranium atoms may split other atoms, creating a chain reaction with extraordinary energy potential. Along with Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard, Fermi constructed the world’s first such controlled chain reaction in 1942. Though that initial chain reaction was not strong enough to power even one light bulb, it paved the way for future work in nuclear research and energy production.

This commodious ottoman has since been removed, to the extreme regret of all weak-kneed lovers of the fine arts, but the gentleman in question had taken serene possession of its softest spot, and, with his head thrown back and his legs outstretched, was staring at Murillo's beautiful moon-borne Madonna in profound enjoyment of his posture. He had removed his hat, and flung down beside him a little red guide-book and an opera-glass. The day was warm; he was heated with walking, and he repeatedly passed his handkerchief over his forehead, with a somewhat wearied gesture.

Grape vines may be pruned at any time during the winter. It is the practice among most grape-growers in the north to prune as time permits from November to late in February, or even early March. The sap flows very freely from cuts made in spring and early summer, causing the phenomenon known as “bleeding,” or in Europe as “weeping,” and in order to prevent this loss, pruning is stopped six weeks or more before the time at which the buds usually swell. It is yet a moot point if this bleeding injures the vine, but it is a safe practice to prune early. The vine is cut off an inch or two beyond the last bud which it is desired to leave, in order to avoid injury to the bud from the drying out of the end of the cane.

Strength, bravery, dexterity, and unfaltering nerve and resolution must be the portion and attribute of those who resolve to pursue fortune along the rugged road of life. Their path will often lie amid rocks and crags, and not on lawns and among lilies. A great action is always preceded by a great purpose. History and daily life are full of examples to show us that the measure of human achievements has always been proportional to the amount of human daring and doing. Deal with questions and facts of life as they really are. What can be done, and is worth doing, do with dispatch; what cannot be done, or would be worthless when done, leave for the idlers and dreamers along life’s highway.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	Success often requires a great deal of effort.
B.	It is human nature to strive for something better.
C.	Dreamers tend to set their sights on impractical goals.
D.	People who possess a noble purpose are an inspiration to others.

Integrity is the mother of knowledge. The desire for truth is the basis of all learning, the value of all experience and the reason for all study and investigation. Without integrity as a basis, our entire educational system would fall to the ground; all newspapers and magazines would become sources of great danger and the publication of books would have to be suppressed. Our whole civilization rests upon the assumption that people are honest. With this confidence shaken, the structure falls. And it should fall, for, unless the truth be taught, the nation would be much better off without its schools, newspapers, books and professions. 

Which of the following best restates the author’s main point?

A.	Media censorship may be needed for an honest society.
B.	A dishonest educational system creates civil unrest.
C.	Faith in the honesty of people provides stability.
D.	Civilization relies on the honesty of the media.

Despite the growth of the federal government’s role in education, the U.S. Department of Education has never strayed far from its official mission: to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access. The education department carries out its mission in two major ways. First, the department and its education secretary play a leadership role in the ongoing national dialogue over how to improve the results of our education system for all students. This involves such activities as raising national and community awareness of the education challenges confronting the nation, disseminating the latest discoveries on what works in teaching and learning, and helping communities work out solutions to difficult educational issues. Second, the department pursues its twin goals of access and excellence through the administration of programs that cover every area of education and range from preschool education through postdoctoral research.

In discussing the U.S. Department of Education, the author's primary focus is on its

A.	programs.
B.	mission.

After that, he simmers the chicken bones in water for several hours to make the stock. He uses some of the chicken stock to make rice in a rice cooker, and the rest is put in a pot as the base for the soup. Kai knows that I like both light and dark meat, so he chops up some of each to add to the pot along with garlic, rosemary, and thyme. He lets these ingredients simmer while he rinses and chops the celery, carrots, and onions and then adds them to the pot as well. After the soup has cooked for about thirty minutes, he stirs in the cooked rice and heats it through. Then, just before serving, he adds his secret ingredient: fresh lime juice.

According to the passage, what should be added to the soup pot at the same time as the chicken?

In fact, even before he got his license, he loved driving his motorcycle up and down the long driveway of his home. Rick’s parents both rode motorcycles, and his fondest childhood memory was riding to town to get ice cream with his mom on a hot summer afternoon. During the winter, when the road conditions were rough, he would help his parents overhaul their bikes to ensure the tires and brakes were in good working order. Now, his daughter is old enough to get her first motorcycle, and she has been looking for a used bike that needs some minor repairs. Even though it was many years ago, it seems like yesterday when Rick picked out his first bike with his dad.

In 1830 it was a snug collection of modest one- and two-story frame dwellings, whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose vines, honeysuckles, and morning glories. Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds, touch-me-nots, prince's-feathers, and other old-fashioned flowers; while on the windowsills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame.

She stood up, stretched, and heard her stomach growl, so she walked to the concession stand near the playground to get a snack. However, there were about ten people in line ahead of her. Not wanting to wait, Hanh wandered over to the playground. She noticed the swings offered a great view of the soccer field, and she headed for the nearest empty one. It wasn’t long before she was swinging high in the air. She realized that, in addition to being fun, swinging was a pretty good workout.

As soon as I hook on his leash, he gets excited and begins to run around the perimeter of the living room. I let him play like this before we head out so that he can expel some of his pent-up energy. Once we start walking, his ears bounce up and down like flapping wings, and his mouth opens wide to let his tongue hang out and cool him down. We walk the same three-mile route every day, which provides Bailey with the fresh air, exercise, and familiarity he craves.

Even now, after ten years of teaching and leading dozens of excavations in several different countries, I sometimes have to remind myself that my career isn’t just a dream. My mother tells me that, when I was a toddler, I was fascinated with playing in the dirt and digging things up. In fact, for my seventh birthday, my mother gave me my first real tool: an antique trowel with a red handle. This was my most treasured possession because it was just the right size for my small hands. My new trowel gave me the confidence I needed, and I soon mastered some basic techniques—marking out a grid, digging, and then sieving the soil to ensure that nothing had been overlooked. I took my trowel with me everywhere but learned a hard lesson when I dug into a neighbor’s flowerbed.

While that may be true in some places, my memories lead me to associate the deserts of the southwestern region of the United States with melodious birdsong. The doves begin nature’s chorus by cooing contentedly as they rise with the sun. Other birds gradually wake up and start chattering, until a cacophony of avian conversations flit through the air. Birds aren’t the only ones making noise, though. Around midday, insects join in, providing brief staccato bursts of sound. If you listen closely, you can hear lizards scrabbling in the rocks, and more often than not, the day ends with the lonely howl of a coyote as the pale moon emerges at twilight.

It was nothing he could put his finger on exactly, just several small things that, put together, were making him wonder whether a memo had circulated that he had missed. The peculiarity of the day continued when he discovered an “out of order” sign posted on the downstairs refrigerator. Putting his lunch in the rarely used upstairs fridge, Juan noticed it was well-stocked with catered food and beverages. As he made his way back to his desk, everyone greeted Juan more heartily than they typically did. Two colleagues who had been whispering in front of his cubicle looked startled when he approached and then muttered something about needing to talk to the maintenance department.

After a while, she settled down in the cool grass to rest quietly as the squirrels continued their activities. Soon, the squirrels seemed to forget that she was there, and a few ventured to the ground in search of the tastiest acorns. She wished that one of the squirrels would come closer so that she could get a better look at the small creature. She studied how they moved and wondered if she was as fast as they were. Suddenly, without even thinking about it, she lunged for the nearest squirrel, but the critter easily out-maneuvered her and scampered into the oak’s highest branches. The other squirrels followed suit, and she moaned in exasperation and circled the tree. Soon, weary from her exertions, she stretched out on the grass again and fell asleep in the morning sun.

Instead of asking visitors to keep their distance from the exhibits, these types of art museums invite visitors to touch and interact with the displays. We noticed that, in addition to being more entertaining, hands-on exhibits stimulate learning and discovery. When we actively participated in creating art, we found that we tended to learn more about the subject and to retain that knowledge for a longer period of time. For example, although I am not a talented artist, I participated in an exhibit that guided visitors through creating four different paintings of the same subject using a different artistic style for each one. While I certainly didn’t create any masterpieces, the act of replicating the various techniques gave me a deeper understanding of the unique components of each style.

Though each specialized in one event—Ian was a sprinter, Drew threw the javelin, Adil ran hurdles, and Ramiro ran long-distance—the four athletes especially looked forward to competing together as a team in the relay race. They had spent countless hours practicing the baton handoff. Their diligent training allowed their exchanges to be so smooth and precisely timed that they barely lost any time when they switched runners. Furthermore, instead of always running in the same order, each athlete was comfortable running in any position. All season, they switched the order from one meet to the next, which confounded their competitors. The team also perfected its starting block technique, because a fast start is crucial and can affect the whole race.

The power of preserving silence is the very first requisite to all who wish to shine, or even please in discourse; and those who cannot preserve it, have really no business to speak. Of course, I do not mean the dull, ignorant, sulky, or supercilious silence, of which we see enough in all conscience; but the graceful, winning and eloquent silence. The silence that, without any deferential air, listens with polite attention, is more flattering than compliments, and more frequently broken for the purpose of encouraging others to speak, than to display the listener’s own powers.

However, glassy materials can also be formed by natural phenomena. Volcanic glass, or obsidian, is formed when viscous lava is rapidly cooled. Meteoritic glass, or tektites, are produced when a meteorite collides with the earth’s surface, and a fulgurite is a glassy tube formed when a bolt of lightning strikes rock or sand. In addition, certain deep-sea sponges, commonly called glass sponges, have silica skeletons composed of enzyme-produced spicules that exhibit glass-like qualities.

By recycling, we can reduce the need for freshwater and reduce how much wastewater flows into sewers and septic tanks. One recycling method involves treating and reusing wastewater from toilets, considered “blackwater,” for purposes such as groundwater replenishment, toilet flushing, irrigation, and industrial processes. Another method collects and reuses “greywater,” which is generally defined as water that drains from household sinks, showers, bathtubs, dishwashers, and clothes washing machines. In some regions, homeowners can obtain permits to use greywater systems for watering their yards or flushing their toilets. Water reclamation practices can be implemented in a variety of climates, regions, and facilities, advancing environmental stewardship.

In an effort to conserve fuel, it was first enacted during World War I. However, when it was repealed at the end of that war, some cities and states chose to remain on DST rather than resetting the time. DST was reinstated on a year-round basis during World War II. After World War II, there were no standard rules for DST until Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966, which formalized the start and end dates of daylight saving time. Interestingly, DST was not a federal obligation, and local jurisdictions could decide whether or not to observe the time changes. Since then, Congress has enacted other laws affecting DST, and states are still allowed to opt out of DST. Arizona is one of those states, primarily for pragmatic reasons. In the state’s hot desert climate, more daylight in the evening would mean residents would end up burning more fossil fuels by running their air conditioners for longer periods.

According to the passage, a state rejected Congress’s DST rules because the state wanted to

A.	conserve energy.

The ratio of binder to pigment determines the hardness or softness of the pastel stick. Hard pastels contain more binder than soft pastels, and they stay sharper for longer periods of time, making them the preferred tool for fine, crisp lines. Soft pastels, however, have more pigment and less binder, making them more vibrant than hard pastels and easier to blend and smudge. While the powdered pigments used in pastels are similar to those used in oil paints, pastels have one of the highest concentrations of pigment in an artistic medium.

The passage suggests that hard pastels are

A.	ideal for art with intricate details.

He received a learned education: he was a profound and elegant classical scholar: he had studied all the mysteries of rabbinical literature: he was intimately acquainted with every language in modern Europe from which either pleasure or information was then to be derived. He was perhaps the only poet of later times who has been distinguished by the excellence of his Latin verse. The genius of Petrarch was scarcely of the first order; and his poems in the ancient language, though much praised by those who have never read them, are wretched compositions. Cowley, with all his admirable wit and ingenuity, had little imagination: nor, indeed, do we think his classical diction comparable to that of Milton.

The part of the nail that is visible is actually called the nail plate and is supported by the surrounding skin known as the nail folds. The tissue that produces the nail plate cells and includes blood vessels and nerves is called the matrix. The skin underneath the nail plate is called the nail bed. At the opposite end of the free edge of the nail is the cuticle, which protects the nail plate as it grows. The white half-moon shape where the nail plate meets the cuticle is known as the lunula. Fingernails help us in many ways, including protecting our fingertips from injury, enhancing dexterity and tactile sensation, and serving as built-in tools.

2652.	The color of human eyes can be as diverse and unique as fingerprints, because the color is determined by the amount of pigment present in the structure called the iris. The primary pigments responsible for this characteristic are melanin and lipochrome. Typically, the more melanin that is present in the iris, the darker it will appear. So, irises with relatively low levels of melanin will appear lighter, more often on the blue spectrum, than irises with higher levels of melanin, which usually appear dark brown. Although it is rare, it is possible for a person to be born with one iris that has two different-colored sections or a pair of irises that don’t match each other in color. However, while some people report noticing a change in eye color depending on the shade of clothing they are wearing, eye color does not actually change from day to day. The perceived color change is most likely due to changes in lighting and the hue of surrounding colors.

In discussing the human eye, the author’s primary focus is on the

A.	perceptions of iris color.
B.	range of possible iris colors.
C.	unusual patterns of iris color.
D.	chemistry of different iris colors.

For example, Leghorn hens always lay white-shelled eggs, while Rhode Island Red hens always lay brown-shelled eggs. However, two hens of the same breed will not necessarily lay eggs with yolks of the same color. While breed influences shell color, it is the hen’s diet that is primarily responsible for the tint of the egg yolk. If a hen’s diet is high in foods that contain pigments called xanthophylls, such as yellow corn or alfalfa, the hen’s yolks will be a dark yellow-orange color. Hens with diets high in wheat or barley will lay eggs that have pale yellow yolks. Similarly, if a hen is fed cornmeal almost exclusively, it will produce eggs with almost colorless yolks.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	compare the different colors of egg shells.
B.	recommend the best diet for egg-laying hens.
C.	encourage production of more varieties of eggs.
D.	explain what determines the color of an egg yolk.

Sometimes the position of a word may be considered appropriate by some, and inappropriate by others, according to different interpretations of the sentence. Take as an example, “Early in the morning the nobles and gentlemen who attended on the king assembled in the great hall of the castle; and here they began to talk of what a dreadful storm it had been the night before. But Macbeth could scarcely understand what they said, for he was thinking of something worse.” The last sentence has been amended by Professor Bain into “What they said, Macbeth could scarcely understand.” But there appears to be an antithesis between the guiltless nobles who can think about the weather, and the guilty Macbeth who cannot. Hence, “what they said” ought not, and “Macbeth” ought, to be emphasized: and therefore “Macbeth” ought to be retained at the beginning of the sentence.

The author of the passage is most likely trying to

A.	caution against the misinterpretation of phrases.
B.	criticize the original structure of the example.
C.	recommend italics for emphasizing words.
D.	illustrate how word order affects meaning.

His mother was the daughter of a wealthy wholesale grocer, and his father was a wicker furniture manufacturer from Maryland. Soon after Fitzgerald was born, the family moved from Minnesota to upstate New York, living there about twelve years until they returned to Minnesota in 1908. There, Fitzgerald developed an early affinity for writing and one of his detective stories was published in the school newspaper. He moved to New Jersey to attend prep school and then college, where he befriended literary figures including Edmund Wilson and John Peale Bishop. However, in 1917, Fitzgerald left the university to join the army. While enlisted in the armed services, he continued writing, and, at the age of 21, finished his first novel titled The Romantic Egotist. Publishers rejected the novel twice before accepting it under the title This Side of Paradise. Once published, the book launched Fitzgerald’s career.

According to the passage, one of Fitzgerald’s detective stories was written in

Workers excavated and built the anchorages for the two towers first, which were designed to hold approximately 63 million pounds. It took over two years to complete each 12-story anchorage, one in San Francisco and one in Marin, and the anchorages were completed, respectively, in May and June of 1935. While workers built the anchorages, however, construction commenced on other parts of the bridge, including the towers, which were made out of prefabricated steel sections. After the catwalks were constructed, workers started spinning the main cables, which were designed to transfer most of the weight of the bridge to the towers. In 1937, just over four years after construction had begun, the bridge was opened to pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	The two anchorages were constructed in two months.
B.	The cables were spun before the catwalks were completed. 
C.	The two towers were constructed of prefabricated steel parts.

From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the Pilgrim’s Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate little volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's Historical Collections; they were small chapmen’s books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father’s little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way, since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch’s Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great advantage.

Initially, inventors attempted to create large-scale wings that could be attached to the arms, or machines with flapping mechanical wings called ornithopters that would, theoretically, allow people to fly like birds. Though these contraptions were unsuccessful, humanity’s efforts to take to the skies persisted. Near the end of the eighteenth century, two French brothers named Montgolfier achieved success with a piloted linen air balloon powered by fire, but their invention was not considered a practical way to travel. Then, in 1804, Sir George Cayley built the first true airplane in the form of a glider featuring a kite-shaped wing with an adjustable tail. However, it wasn’t until 1903, nearly one hundred years later, that Orville and Wilbur Wright built the first powered, heavier-than-air controlled aircraft.

Born in New York in 1923, Lichtenstein’s talents in art and music were apparent from an early age. After graduating from high school in 1940, he studied painting and drawing in New York over the summer before moving to Ohio to attend university. Drafted in 1943 to serve in World War II, he returned to the U.S. in January of 1946 and received his bachelor’s degree. In the fall of that same year, he began teaching at a college while also working on his master’s degree. Although he had his first solo show in a New York art gallery in 1951, it wasn’t until 1961 that his artistic career really took off. Lichtenstein’s breakthrough happened when he developed his own unique style based on comic strip images with his hallmark dots in the background. These dots were enlarged versions of the tiny dot patterns used in the commercial engraving process. Lichtenstein died in 1997 at the age of 73, but his influence over modern art continues to live on.

Greg apologized profusely for waking Millie, but explained that his car wouldn’t start, and he needed a ride home. Millie agreed to pick him up and quickly got directions. When Millie arrived at the scene, she decided to take a look at Greg’s car. She thought it might be a faulty ignition switch, so she turned the key to the “start” position. She could hear a clicking noise, but the starter would not crank. She then checked the battery cables for looseness or corrosion. Because Greg’s battery was fairly new, she also checked to make sure that the starter solenoid terminals were in good condition, but eventually determined that Greg’s car battery had indeed died. Always prepared, she brought out her jumper cables, and soon Greg was on the road, and Millie was on her way back to bed.

Born around 1450, Bosch came from a family of artists; his grandfather, father, uncles, and brother were all painters. Beyond this, and his marriage around 1480, little is known about Bosch’s life or training. He never dated his paintings and likely only signed a portion of them. He painted numerous triptychs—paintings divided into three sections or panels—most of which featured religious concepts as their principal subject matter. Bosch often used surreal iconography in his work, including his most famous painting The Garden of Earthly Delights. After Bosch’s death, a member of the Spanish royalty, King Philip II of Spain, became an especially devoted admirer of Bosch’s work. Today, an esteemed art museum in Spain holds many of Bosch’s cherished masterpieces.

Although he arrived in the late 1700s, he was in fact not the first newcomer to the region. Historical documents reveal that the explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet spent a summer in the Chicago area while navigating the Mississippi River in 1673.

The principles of electromagnetic induction were established by English physicist Michael Faraday in 1830. However, it was a Scottish scientist named James Clerk Maxwell who postulated that electromagnetic currents could be transmitted through space and travel at the speed of light. In the 1890s, Italian Guglielmo Marconi invented the vertical antenna, which in a few years allowed him to broadcast the first radio signal across the Atlantic. In 1906, Canadian-born physicist Reginald Fessenden sent the first long-distance transmission of a human voice and music over the airwaves. Perhaps more memorably, in 1910, American inventor Lee de Forest was able to broadcast a live operatic performance by figuring out how to amplify weak radio signals.

The pierogi, for example, is from Poland, and flomaria is a pasta from the Greek isle of Lemnos. Legend has it that the Italian explorer Marco Polo introduced pasta to Italy during the thirteenth century, when he brought noodles back from China. However, evidence suggests that pasta was already available in certain parts of Italy before Polo left for China. Archaeologists are convinced that pasta descends from the ancient central Asian noodle, and that over time, pasta made its way westward. Along the way, the process of making pasta was altered. In the Mediterranean region, durum wheat, with its high protein content and long shelf life, became the preferred ingredient for pasta flour.

However, the Constitution could not go into effect until at least nine of the existing thirteen states had ratified it. Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution on December 7 of that year. Quickly following suit, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut, in turn, ratified it, but Massachusetts delayed ratification until February 6, 1788, when a special agreement between the state’s federalists and antifederalists was made. This agreement, known as the Massachusetts Compromise, involved recommending amendments to the document once it went into effect. After Maryland and then South Carolina voted to ratify, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the Constitution on June 21, 1788, establishing it as the law of the land.

According to the passage, which of the following states voted to ratify the Constitution immediately before Connecticut did?

However, Fitzgerald also wrote many great short stories and essays as well as three other novels, including Tender Is the Night, which has been relatively neglected. Written over a nine-year period, Tender is the Night was easily Fitzgerald’s most ambitious novel. In this work, Fitzgerald experimented radically with narrative chronology and point of view. Among the first books ever to depict a modern psychiatrist as its protagonist, it draws on the early advances in psychiatry and the ideas of famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Despite its grand scope, the novel is also intensely personal, as the narrative is a thinly veiled portrayal of Fitzgerald’s own life. Due to its complexity, Tender Is the Night will likely never be as popular as The Great Gatsby, but slowly it has gained acceptance as one of the great American classics.

In the passage, the author’s purpose is most likely to

A.	analyze the themes in Tender Is the Night.
B.	praise Fitzgerald’s short stories and essays.
C.	defend Fitzgerald’s interest in psychiatry and Freud.
D.	argue that Tender Is the Night is an underappreciated novel.

Learning to get along with a new housemate can be a challenge for many people, but a good place to start is to establish guidelines for shared places in the home, such as the kitchen and living room, and to stick to those rules. In my experience, good housemates need not have similar likes and dislikes; however, they do need to be considerate of each other’s preferences. Openly discussing and agreeing to standards for cleanliness in shared spaces and deciding together how to organize the contents of cabinets and the refrigerator will help prevent two common sources of conflict. Identifying which belongings can be borrowed and which items are off limits to the other person is also important. With respect for each other and commitment to maintaining the agreed-to guidelines for living together, I believe any housemates can peacefully coexist.

Based on the passage, the author’s attitude towards getting along with a new housemate is

A.	arrogant.

Next, I put in a load of laundry, starting with the sheets. As the washing machine runs, I’m able to focus on the other cleaning tasks, but first, I put on my favorite music. After that, I declutter each room by putting away any stray items that have been left out during the week. Warming up now, I grab my feather duster, and quickly dust each room from top to bottom.

He was in reality the simplest, the most affectionate, and most good-natured of men, the very soul of honor, the best of husbands and fathers and friends, the most fascinating companion that ever lived, and one who kept to the last the freshness and joyous spirits of a school-boy and the heart of a child; one who never said or did an unkind thing; probably never even thought one. Generous and open-handed to a fault, slow to condemn, quick to forgive, and gifted with a power of immediately inspiring affection and keeping it forever after, such as I have never known in any one else, he grew to be (for all his quick-tempered impulsiveness) one of the gentlest and meekest and most humble-minded of men!

About sixty years ago, and somewhat more than twenty miles from the ancient town of Chester, in a southward direction, there stood a large, and, even then, an old-fashioned mansion-house. It lay in the midst of a demesne of considerable extent, and richly wooded with venerable timber; but, apart from the somber majesty of these giant groups, and the varieties of the undulating ground on which they stood, there was little that could be deemed attractive in the place. A certain air of neglect and decay, and an indescribable gloom and melancholy, hung over it. In darkness, it seemed darker than any other tract; when the moonlight fell upon its glades and hollows, they looked spectral and awful, with a sort of churchyard loneliness; and even when the blush of the morning kissed its broad woodlands, there was a melancholy in the salute that saddened rather than cheered the heart of the beholder.

The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theater, which filled almost the whole ground story and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theater to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.

But we may perhaps ascribe these circumstances to the fact of finding the Greens, generation after generation, made the dupes of more astute minds, and when the hour of danger came, left to manage their own affairs in the best way they could,—a way that commonly ended in their mismanagement and total confusion. Indeed, the idiosyncrasy of the family appears to have been so well known, that we continually meet with them performing the character of catspaw to some monkey who had seen and understood much more of the world than they had,—putting their hands to the fire, and only finding out their mistake when they had burned their fingers.

Despite the warmth of the sun, the stream was as cold as ice, which was hardly surprising since it originated from the snowfield far above. Nevertheless, I gasped as I plunged my worn and weary feet into the chill water. It took only a few seconds for my feet to go from achy to numb, so I lifted them out to dry in the sun.

He is famous for his accomplishments related to the Rosetta Stone, a smooth-faced rock discovered in 1799 and inscribed with a decree written in Greek and ancient Egyptian scripts. As a young man, Champollion mastered many languages, including Latin, Greek, Persian, Coptic, and Arabic. His profound interest in languages led to his intensive study of Egyptian hieroglyphics—a system of writing that used picture symbols and had been extinct for nearly 2,000 years. After analyzing the Rosetta Stone and considering the preliminary deciphering work done by English physicist Thomas Young, Champollion eventually achieved major breakthroughs in understanding the stone’s Egyptian engravings. Champollion shared his work with the rest of the world by creating a list of Egyptian hieroglyphs. By decoding the ancient Rosetta Stone, Champollion provided the key for further study of the language and culture of the ancient Egyptians.

The small flying insects devoured native vegetation and a variety of crops, including wheat, corn, potatoes, and even tobacco. During the “year of the locust,” trillions of locusts hatched. The swarms were so concentrated that they resembled dark clouds and blocked the sunlight for several hours as they passed overhead. People tried many things to get rid of the pests, including driving them away with smoke from burning fires; but it was no use, the locusts were simply too numerous. A severe drought accompanied the rapid increase in the locust population, and the combination of weather conditions and insect invasion devastated crops. Many farmers went into debt and some relocated to escape the destruction. Though federal and state agencies provided farmers with some monetary assistance and other resources, the final solution was to wait for the locust population to decline, which it eventually did.

The young Pascal began exploring mathematics at the age of 12 even though his father, who was his teacher, planned to exclude the subject from his curriculum until the boy was 15 years old. Some say the father’s plan only served to increase the boy’s interest, for he started studying geometry on his own. Despite having no mathematics texts available to him, Pascal correctly discovered the pattern for finding the sum of any triangle’s interior angles. This impressed Pascal’s father, who revised his plan for the boy’s education in light of his son’s passion and aptitude for geometry. With his father’s support, Pascal became an accomplished mathematician, philosopher, and scientist. Some of his major contributions include the development of mathematical theorems, philosophical writings, and the invention of a working mechanical calculator, which is considered to be an early form of the computer.

Bottles have been picked up at sea thousands of miles from the point where they have been cast into the waters. They have been the sport of wind and weather; carried along by ocean currents, they have reached a destination undreamed of.

A cruel smile, a shrug of the shoulders or a cleverly eloquent silence may ruin in a moment the reputation a man or woman has been building for years.

The force of the shock wave that followed the event was as powerful as five megatons of an explosive. Fortunately, the blast occurred far from any human-populated areas, but nearly 500,000 acres of forest were decimated, felling about 80 million trees. The trees were found lying on their sides in a radial pattern with their crowns pointing away from the epicenter of the explosion. At the epicenter, the trees were still standing, but all the branches had been stripped away. The event also caused dense clouds to build over the region. These clouds were stacked so high that they reflected light from beyond the horizon, lighting up the night sky. What was the cause of this event? Nobody knows for certain, but based on the evidence collected, the strongest theory is that an object from space, most likely a meteor, hurtled toward Earth and detonated in the atmosphere before it hit the ground.

More people than ever before were living in cities rather than on farms, and national wealth more than doubled. Perhaps due to the rapid changes and dreams of extravagance, farmers, businesses, and consumers all made imprudent decisions: farmers produced an excess of food, businesses supplied goods of low demand, and a rapidly growing middle class made hasty decisions on the stock market.

The names of the suburbs afford food for reflection. Yarra is the only native name. Sir Charles Hotham and Sir Charles Fitzroy were the governors at the time of the foundation of the municipalities which bear their names. The date of the foundation of St. Kilda is evidenced by the name of its streets—Alma, Inkerman, Redan, Malakoff, Sebastopol, Raglan, Cardigan, and Balaclava, the last of which gave its name later on to a new suburb, which grew up at one end of it. In the city proper the principal streets are named after colonial celebrities in the early days—Flinders, Bourke, Collins, Lonsdale, Spencer, Stephen, Swanston, while King, Queen, and William Streets each tell a tale.

According to the passage, which of the following street names was later used to name a new suburb?

A.	Balaclava

For the sake of comparison, Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, is approximately 29,000 feet above sea level. The Mariana Trench is also nearly 1,600 miles long, which is about the length of five Grand Canyons. Despite the very harsh living conditions of the Mariana Trench—especially at its deepest trough, which is known as the Challenger Deep—a few species have somehow managed to adapt to its extreme pressure, frigid temperatures, and complete absence of light. These organisms include the single-celled xenophyophores, which are believed to resemble some of the earliest forms of life on Earth; the holothurian, a translucent sea-cucumber-like creature; and amphipods, which resemble shrimp.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	The earliest life forms originated in the Mariana Trench.
B.	The Challenger Deep contains the deepest known point on Earth.

During our annual family reunion in 1998, Uncle Richard gave his cousin Nellie a tee shirt printed with the phrase, “My favorite relative is Richard.” We all got a big laugh out of that, and a picture of her wearing the shirt was featured on the reunion invitation for 1999. At that reunion, Nellie gave the tee shirt to her cousin Paula, but only after Nellie had crossed out Richard and written in her own name. A tradition was born. Reggie was given the shirt in 2000, and Barry received it in 2001. That shirt has been passed along every year since, and this year I was the lucky recipient. I’ve already crossed out Emma’s name and written in my own, but I haven’t yet figured out who I should give the tee shirt to next year.

She had only one part left to purchase and install before she could get the truck running again. She had been working on her truck for nearly two months and was proud of her progress, but she often wondered if it was worth the effort. After all, commuting to work by bus had proven to be an inexpensive and reliable alternative. Nevertheless, Kamilla believed that she might have finally found the part she needed at the right price, and had sent the seller a message just before the meeting. Kamilla was anxious for the seller’s response and kept checking her e-mail. Soon she could be back to her old routine of having a vehicle to get around in when she wanted to, rather than always needing to hop on the bus and be carried through the city, enjoying the sights along the way.

Based on the passage, it is likely that Kamilla will

2714.	Often considered a modern technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)—popularly referred to as drones—have actually been used by the United States military for decades. One early form of drone was the aerial torpedo, which emerged during World War I. These planes were designed to be launched from a slingshot-like apparatus, fly for a specific number of engine revolutions, and then fall onto their targets by abruptly releasing their wings. The number of engine revolutions was calculated by taking into account the direction and speed of the wind and the desired distance. However, these planes rarely worked, and the war ended before they could be refined or deployed. Equally ineffective, World War II’s version of the drone involved a human pilot flying a refitted bomber to cruising altitude and then parachuting out of it, after which a human-occupied mothership would attempt to control the vacated bomber remotely. During the Vietnam War, surveillance drones were widely used, but it wasn’t until the technological advancements of the 1980s and 1990s that the use of modern-day drones as weapons became practical.

The history of Egypt, from the time of the earliest extant monuments to the absorption of the country in the Roman Empire, covers a space of some thousands of years. This long period was not one of stagnation. It is only in proportion to our ignorance that life in ancient Egypt seems to have been on one dull, dead level. Dynasties rose and fell. Foreign invaders occupied the land and were expelled again. Customs, costumes, beliefs, institutions, underwent changes. Of course, then, art did not remain stationary. On the contrary, it had marked vicissitudes, now displaying great freshness and vigor, now uninspired and monotonous, now seemingly dead, and now reviving to new activity.

Based on the passage, the view of the narrator is that ancient Egyptian art

A.	has been largely neglected by art historians.

However, in my opinion, English should usher in some fresh ones and bring back a few obsolete punctuation marks. Two examples of the former are the exclamation comma and the question comma, which look exactly like their standard counterparts—the exclamation point and the question mark—except that commas are used at the bottom instead of points. After all, as most of us know, excitement and inquisitiveness can occur midsentence! They can also occur simultaneously, which is why some people are starting to use the new interrobang—a question mark superimposed on an exclamation point. An example of an obsolete mark is the percontation point, which looks like a mirror image of a question mark and was once used to end rhetorical questions. Perhaps the digital age, having already saved the “at” sign from obscurity, will open the door to new forms of punctuation.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

The idea of giving, by means of photography, full-sized reproductions of my specimens of ancient needle and bobbin-made lace, originated from a desire to avoid unfolding these delicate fabrics when my friends wished to see them. By arranging carefully that several of the photographs should give the exact size of each stitch of the work, seeing and handling the originals have been rendered practically unnecessary. Though many books on lace exist giving most valuable historic, artistic and technical data, none with which I am acquainted give the practical information I have found most desired, that is to say, full-sized representations of the pieces of lace.

The subway serves about 4.5 million passengers per day, and it is the only rapid transit system in the world that operates around the clock, 365 days a year. In fact, since its opening on October 27, 1904, the New York City subway has only been completely shut down one time, due to a snowstorm. In addition, the New York City subway has 468 stations scattered across the city and about 650 miles of track serving its passengers.

Both types may visit the same country, for example, but leave with strikingly different observations. That’s not to say that one type is better than the other; but rather that it simply depends on your preferences. If you’re going to Italy strictly for leisure, you might take a gondola ride in Venice, take a tour of Rome, and then visit Pisa to see the Leaning Tower—all worthwhile things to do. But if you’re not going solely for leisure but also to learn—to really get a taste of what Italy is like to Italians—then you wouldn’t venture only to places where there are a lot of tourists. Rather, you might go to lesser-known Italian towns like Alba, which is known for its dark chocolate and truffles, or to Salsomaggiore Terme, a town surrounded by rolling green hills and featuring a nineteenth-century spa. Such places are free from the distracting commercialism that often characterize popular tourist destinations, allowing travelers to really experience and appreciate another culture.

The history of the Louvre dates back to 1190 when King Philip II built the enclosed fortress to protect the city of Paris. However, it was not until the reign of King Francis I in the year 1546 that the fortress was transformed into a palace and the Louvre began to take form as a royal residence for the kings of France. After King Henry IV assumed the throne in 1589, he built a large gallery within the Louvre, welcoming artists to work and reside on the lower levels of the building. Later, during the seventeenth century, Louis XIII and Louis XIV made significant changes to the original structure, including the completion of the Denon Wing and addition of the Richelieu Wing. The Louvre continued to transform over time, and eventually developed into one of the most prominent art museums in the world.

She had to decide if she wanted to read poems by several different poets or focus on just one author, or if she should select poems that shared a common theme. As Jane flipped through the pages of Margolin’s book, she noticed many pages were bent down at the corners and the binding was practically falling apart. However, she wasn’t particularly worried about the loose pages because she had already memorized many of the poems. Jane set down Margolin’s book and thumbed through the others.

There were twenty wagons in the train, and of these two barricades had been made, one at the upper and the other at the lower end of the cliffs, as the guide had directed. The vehicles had been drawn close together, and were fastened to one another by chains so that they could not be easily moved from their places.

2726.	Human hearing results from a series of events. First, sound waves travel through the air and reach the ear canal—the narrow passageway leading to the tympanic membrane, or ear drum. The sound waves that enter the ear canal vibrate the ear drum. This causes the malleus, a small bone connected to the eardrum, to vibrate and transmit energy to two small bones named the incus and the stapes, or the middle ear. These small bones vibrate and transfer energy to the oval window, which vibrates and transfers energy to a snail-shaped, fluid-filled structure of the inner ear known as the cochlea. The fluid in the cochlea begins to ripple, and a traveling wave forms along the elastic membrane. There, the tiny hair cells in the organ of Corti translate the fluid vibration into electrical impulses that are then sent to the brain, thus allowing a person to recognize sound.

The Pindaric ode, named after the ancient Greek poet Pindar, was designed to be performed at public events, complete with a chorus and dancers, and was often used to celebrate athletic victories. It has a formal opening, also called a strophe, followed by an antistrophe that mirrors the opening, and an epode, or third part, of a different length and metrical structure. In contrast, Horatian odes, named after the Roman poet Horace, typically follow a regular stanza pattern, are more introspective and less ceremonious than Pindaric odes, and have a notably informal tone. The irregular ode is quite different from the former two types, as it is free of any formal rhyme scheme and structure. These three varieties of odes have been used in the composition of poems for centuries, illustrating their timeless appeal.

Woad is derived from a plant, Isatis tinctoria, growing in the North of France and in England. It was the only blue dye in the West before Indigo was introduced from India. Since then woad has been little used except as a fermenting agent for the indigo vat. It dyes woollen cloth a greenish color which changes to a deep blue in the air. It is said to be inferior in color to indigo but the color is much more permanent. The leaves when cut are reduced to a paste, kept in heaps for about fifteen days to ferment, and then formed into balls which are dried in the sun; these have a rather agreeable smell and are of a violet color. These balls are subjected to a further fermentation of nine weeks before being used by the dyer. When woad is now used it is always in combination with Indigo, to improve the color. Even by itself, however, it yields a good and very permanent blue.

2729.	A tanka is a 31-syllable Japanese poem that originated during the seventh century. The syllables are typically divided into five lines that follow a five, seven, five, seven, seven syllable pattern. The tanka was popular among Japanese nobles, as well as couples engaged in courtship; its short form and suitability for emotional expression made it the ideal form for intimate exchange. In terms of its focus on emotional expression, the tanka is similar to the sonnet. Also, like the sonnet, a tanka incorporates a shift or a “turn,” wherein the focus of the poem turns from the description of an object to the narrator’s response to that object. This turn typically happens in the third line of a tanka poem, which is considered part of the upper poem, or kami-no-ku, of the tanka. The lower poem, or shimo-no-ku, consists of the last two lines. Although tankas inspired other notable forms of Japanese poetry, this ancient poetic form continues to thrive to this day.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	The tanka inspired the development of the sonnet.

Modern plumbing as a trade is the arranging and running of pipes to supply pure water to buildings, the erecting of fixtures for the use of this supply, and the installing of other pipes for the resulting waste water. The work of the trade divides itself therefore into two parts: first the providing an adequate supply of water; and second, the disposing of this water after use. The first division offers few problems to the plumber, little variety in the layout being possible, and the result depending mostly upon the arrangement of the pipes and fittings; but the second division calls for careful study in the arrangement, good workmanship in the installing, and individual attention to each fixture.

Which of the following statements does the passage suggest about plumbing in the author’s time?

She just didn’t want them to get bored while she was away at work. In fact, Tanya arranged to take the entire week off so she would have plenty of time to bond with the birds and get used to their care routine.

Solution caves are the most common type of cave and occur when rock dissolves above or below the water table. When a solution cave occurs above the water table it may form what are known as dripstones, a result of mineral-laden water seeping through the cave’s ceiling. The most familiar dripstone deposits are stalactites and stalagmites. A stalactite is formed when dissolved minerals in the water slowly build up on the cave’s ceiling over time, forming a deposit that hangs downward like an icicle. Stalagmites form upward as water dripping from the end of a stalactite hits the floor of the cave and deposits minerals. Due to the repeated impact of the falling water droplets, stalagmites often have rounded tops. Over time these two dripstone deposits may grow together, their tips eventually reaching one another, forming what is known as a column.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	geology of caves.

If I had my choice between a farm of cold, stiff clay or light, leachy land, I would unhesitatingly take the former, and I would overcome its native unfitness by the following methods: If at all inclined to be wet, as would be natural from its tenacious texture, I should first underdrain it thoroughly with tile. Then, if I found a fair amount of vegetable matter, I would give it a dressing of air-slaked lime, and plow it deeply late in the fall, leaving it unharrowed so as to expose as much of the soil as possible to the action of frost. Early in the spring, as soon as the ground was dry enough to work and all danger of frost was over, I would harrow in buckwheat and plow it under as it came into blossom; then sow a second crop and plow that under also.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	reasons why clay land is better than leachy land. 
B.	various crops cultivated on clay land.
C.	methods for improving clay land.
D.	natural texture of clay land.

Back then, I used to visit our city park on weekends, and I always noticed the chess players sitting at the picnic tables. It looked like they were having fun, so one day I asked if they would mind giving me a few lessons. They explained how each piece could be moved and described the goal of the game, capturing the opponent’s king. Since then, I’ve been playing chess whenever I get the chance. I believe the game has really improved my strategic thinking skills and my patience level. Not only that, but reading about the history and origins of the game is quite fascinating. I’ve enjoyed meeting new chess players from different backgrounds, and I really think you would like playing this game, too.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

When I’m in the car, I have the freedom to break up my trip in any way I like. I love stopping at local restaurants and exploring interesting attractions along the way. Whenever I can, I try to stay overnight at a bed-and-breakfast place because it gives me the opportunity to talk with people who really know the area. What I like best about road trips, though, is identifying different license plates along the way. One time during a road trip from Oklahoma to South Carolina, I counted thirty-nine license plates from different states across the country, including North Dakota, Delaware, Wyoming, and even Alaska. I also enjoy spotting personalized license plates and trying to decipher their meanings. While flying usually allows me to reach my final destination sooner, I consider the drive as part of the adventure.

For instance, at dawn, just before the sun makes its appearance, the beach is peaceful and still. The early risers embrace the cool air and make the first footprints in the wet sand during their walks and runs. However, once the sun peeks over the horizon, new arrivals head to the shores with towels, umbrellas, and ice chests. The most eager of them brave the cool water right away even though the morning is still gloomy and damp with chill. Slowly, as the sky brightens, more and more people arrive until the beach is alive and glistening in the glare of the midday sun. Undeterred by the heat, the children play in the waves and frantically try to complete their sandcastles before they are washed away by the tide. Finally, after the sun sets, the tired visitors depart, and the starlit beach becomes a soothing and mesmerizing place as it readies itself for a new dawn.

Many things were different about living in a hot, dry climate as opposed to a cool and rainy one. On the one hand, Alan enjoyed the sunny days and the fact that it hardly ever rained. But he found it difficult to adjust to the lack of greenery and the vast expanses of what, to him, appeared to be featureless sand. Not only that, but the extreme heat during the day followed by the abrupt drop in temperature at night meant that Alan was often uncomfortable when he was outdoors. However, the hardest things to get used to were the sand storms that would suddenly engulf the landscape and reduce visibility almost to zero. Alan had a lot to discover about his new home, and growing accustomed to Saudi Arabia’s desert climate was going to be a big part of that adjustment.

The chargers, or large round platters found on every dining-table, were of pewter. Some were so big and heavy that they weighed five or six pounds apiece. Pewter is a metal never seen for modern table furnishing, or domestic use in any form to-day; but in colonial times what was called a garnish of pewter, that is, a full set of pewter platters, plates, and dishes, was the pride of every good housekeeper, and also a favorite wedding gift. It was kept as bright and shining as silver. One of the duties of children was to gather a kind of horse-tail rush which grew in the marshes, and because it was used to scour pewter, was called scouring-rush.

The trail starts off by following the edge of a dry riverbed that is cool and shady. Just beyond a curve in the riverbed at the half-mile mark, the trail veers sharply to the right across a large meadow. Along that section, hikers can see the ridgetop high above them. The trail continues for about a mile until, at the far side of the meadow, it winds between a series of giant boulders as it ascends a long, steep hillside. Sometimes it feels more like a maze than a hiking trail, and I almost forget that I am climbing until I reach the top of the ridge. The trail ends soon after, where a stone bench rewards hikers with a spectacular view of a large reservoir to the east and the vast wilderness beyond.

For another, electronic versions of books do not take up any of the valuable shelf space in my home. However, despite the rising popularity of electronic books and readers, there is nothing like reading a printed book. The feel of the paper, the weight of the book, and, most importantly, the ability to physically flip through the pages are just a few of the reasons I often choose hard-copy books over electronic books.

In fact, he was considered by many to be the most accomplished metal sculptor in St. Louis. Unfortunately for Travis, not many people were commissioning artwork of any kind lately. Then, out of the blue, an art collector contacted him and offered him a sizeable amount of money for a new piece to add to a private collection. However, Travis was understandably disappointed to learn that, instead of a metal sculpture, the potential client wanted one made of wood. Although Travis explained honestly that he was unfamiliar with woodworking techniques, the collector insisted that Travis was the right artist for the job. With great hesitation, even after the art collector agreed to pay extra for all of the woodworking equipment that might be needed, Travis finally accepted the commission. Weeks later, surrounded by a roomful of new woodworking tools, Travis was still trying to figure out how to approach the task.

Their writing is horrendously overcomplicated and anything but enjoyable to read. When they deign to use punctuation at all, they incorporate the most antiquated kind and create long-winded sentences that few can bear read at all, let alone attempt to read in a single breath. What is most irksome, however, is that they rarely, if ever, bother to address a given point succinctly or directly. Instead, they compose vast paragraphs that unnecessarily complicate even the simplest of arguments. If ever I have the occasion to meet one of these perpetrators face-to-face, I will be sure to call their attention to the fact that brevity is a sign of intelligence and that lack of consideration or foresight on their part is never an excuse for taking advantage of the innocent and hapless reader who happens to stumble upon their garrulous narratives.

On September 30, 1930, construction on the dam began, and it was on this day that Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur announced the dam would be called Hoover Dam. The public did not greet this decision with much enthusiasm because many people blamed President Hoover for the economic depression. Nevertheless, on February 14, 1931, the dam was officially named Hoover Dam by an act of Congress. When Hoover lost the presidential election to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, Harold Ickes replaced Wilbur as Secretary of the Interior. Several months later, Ickes stated the structure should thereafter be referred to as Boulder Dam. Though the alternate name was used for nearly 15 years, the name of the dam was never officially changed. To clarify confusion around the use of two different names, a 1947 act of Congress required use of the name of “Hoover Dam,” which remains to this day.

For example, in May of 1940, over four million stockings were sold in the United States within two days. However, in 1942, the popular hosiery disappeared from department stores altogether due to wartime rationing. With the start of World War II, all of the nylon U.S. manufacturers could produce was classified as essential material and channeled into the production of parachutes, mosquito netting, ropes, cords, and a variety of other items useful to the military. Women even donated their old stockings to support the war effort.

Of all the organs by which we acquire a knowledge of external nature, the eye is the most remarkable and the most important. By our other senses the information we obtain is comparatively limited. The touch and the taste extend no farther than the surface of our own bodies. The sense of smell is exercised within a very narrow sphere, and that of recognizing sounds is limited to the distance at which we hear the bursting of a meteor and the crash of a thunderbolt. But the eye enjoys a boundless range of observation. It takes cognizance not only of other worlds belonging to the solar system, but of other systems of worlds infinitely removed into the immensity of space; and when aided by the telescope, the invention of human wisdom, it is able to discover the forms, the phenomena, and the movements of bodies whose distance is as inexpressible in language as it is inconceivable in thought.

A member of the lute family, the word “sitar” comes from a Persian word that means “three-stringed.” The sitar resembles a guitar or a banjo, but it has a much deeper, gourd-shaped body and a much longer neck. In total, it measures about four feet in length. The two primary types of sitars made today feature six to seven main strings that run over the frets along the neck. Of the main strings, some are used to provide the melody, while others provide the rhythm. In addition, the sitar has from eleven to thirteen sympathetic strings that lie beneath the twenty moveable frets and are not plucked directly, but resonate when the main strings are played. To play the instrument, the musician positions the sitar at a forty-five-degree angle while seated. Because of its complexity, the sitar is a notoriously difficult instrument to play. Nevertheless, it remains popular in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

According to the passage, how many main playing strings does the typical modern sitar have?

A full-grown male stands about 34 inches tall at the shoulder and can weigh up to 180 pounds. In fact, a six-month-old Irish Wolfhound puppy is already too heavy for most people to lift. The dog’s historical origins are similarly quite remarkable. Documentation of the breed’s existence can be found in Roman records dating back to 391 AD. Historically, these dogs were used during the Middle Ages in battles and for chasing down large animals, such as wolves, bears, boar, and even cougars. However, today they are praised for their courageous, gentle temperaments and are bred as family dogs. When properly socialized and trained as puppies, they typically do well with other animals and small children and have a notably quiet manner.

According to the passage, modern Irish Wolfhounds are

A.	bred as family dogs.
B.	prized as hunting dogs.
C.	full-grown at six months.
D.	difficult to properly train.

Adjoining the eastern side of the green-house, looking towards the plains of Languedoc, was a room, which Emily called hers, and which contained her books, her drawings, her musical instruments, with some favorite birds and plants. Here she usually exercised herself in elegant arts, cultivated only because they were congenial to her taste, and in which native genius, assisted by the instructions of Monsieur and Madame St. Aubert, made her an early proficient. The windows of this room were particularly pleasant; they descended to the floor, and, opening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house, the eye was led between groves of almond, palm-trees, flowering-ash, and myrtle, to the distant landscape, where the Garonne wandered.

The primary focus of the passage is on

At length she came up, and showed them a wonderful scene of desolation. Beyond the curve of hills the mountains trended out again to the south, gradually growing lower till at last they melted into the skyline. In the vast semicircle thus formed ran the river, spotted with green islands, while between it and the high ground, over a space which varied from one mile at the narrowest to twenty miles in width at the broadest of the curve, was spread a huge and dismal swamp, marked by patches of stagnant water, clothed with reeds which grew to the height of small trees, and exhaling a stench as of the rottenness of ages.

Although famous for his novels that feature the characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain began his writing career with small-scale publications, such as newspaper articles and short stories. Born Samuel Clemens in 1835, Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, a town located along the Mississippi River. In 1848, when he was only 13, he began working as a printer’s apprentice at a newspaper, where he arranged the type used in the printing press. Then, in 1851, when his older brother purchased a newspaper in Hannibal, he went to work for him. Over the next 14 years, while pursuing various careers, such as reporter, riverboat pilot, and miner, Twain wrote stories that were humorous and filled with social satire. Although his work appeared in a variety of periodicals, it wasn’t until the 1865 publication of Twain’s short story “Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog” that Twain gained widespread popularity. In addition to his numerous short stories, Twain published 28 books over the course of his long career.

The California poppy grows in a variety of environments, including coastal dunes, arid plains, open slopes in redwood forests, inland valleys, and along the edges of deserts; however, it is not found in the high alpine meadows. This flower has four petals and most often blooms during the springtime in areas with adequate sunlight and available water. However, in coastal regions where water is readily available for a longer period of time due to increased rainfall and fog, the California poppy often continues to bloom throughout the year. Although the California poppy grows wild throughout California and is the state flower, there is another poppy, Eschscholzia mexicana, that grows in the eastern part of the golden state.

First, lilacs do best when planted during the spring or fall months in fertile, well-drained soil. Before planting, however, it is a good idea to test the acidity or alkalinity level of the soil. Lilacs prefer neutral to slightly alkaline levels for optimal growth. Next, amend the soil by incorporating compost. Be sure to dig the hole where you will put the plant about as deep as the root ball and about twice as wide. Once the hole has been dug, place the plant gently in the bottom, fill the hole halfway with soil, and add water to settle the roots and eliminate air pockets. Then you can fill up the rest of the hole with soil. Finally, create a dam around the root zone, water thoroughly, and apply a layer of mulch around the plant to reduce weeds and retain moisture.

Based on the passage, what should be done just after completely filling the hole with soil?

A.	apply a layer of mulch

King Tutankhamun—commonly known as “King Tut”—was a young Egyptian pharaoh who lived around 1400 BC. The ancient Egyptians buried their pharaohs in ornate tombs brimming with treasures. However, when Carter arrived in Egypt in 1891, many of these tombs had been looted centuries earlier. In 1917, after decades spent working at various excavation sites, Carter received funding for his search for the tomb of King Tut. Five years later, on November 4, 1922, Carter and his team discovered steps near the entrance of an unknown tomb. Within weeks, they found the insignia of Tutankhamun on a first sealed doorway, and through another sealed doorway they glimpsed a breathtaking cache of priceless treasures—gold shrines, jewelry, and other ancient artifacts. By 1932, the treasures found in King Tut’s tomb had been catalogued and sent to a world-famous museum in Cairo, Egypt, where they permanently reside.

Space gloves, like the entire space suit, are designed to maintain atmospheric pressure, which is necessary to support human life in space. But because the gloves essentially form stiff balloons around each finger, fine motor control is very challenging. With the fingers subjected to constant pressure, simple tasks like grasping an object are not only difficult but can also be quite painful. Recently, the availability of new materials and advancements in creating glove molds from laser scanning have reduced the bulk and weight of the gloves while providing a more custom fit.

This can be quite difficult to do but is fun to try if you’re camping. First, find a flat piece of wood for the fireboard—look for dry softwoods such as cedar or pine—and select a strong, pointed stick. Next, collect a few handfuls of dried grass to serve as tinder and gather some small, dry twigs for kindling. Then, use a knife or sharp rock to cut a groove down the middle of the fireboard. With the fireboard on the ground, rub the tip of the stick up and down the groove, pressing hard to create some wood dust. The friction will heat up the wood dust on the fireboard, and as the temperature increases, these particles should ignite and become embers. Finally, safely transfer the embers to the tinder, gently blow on them, and slowly add the kindling.

Narrow-minded in the extreme, with a heart which had not one benevolent impulse, he was far from being a fit officer to be placed in authority over the people of Rhode Island, who could be more easily conquered by lenient measures than by the use of unnecessary harshness.

We are fond of comparing flying machines with birds, with fish, and with ships: and there are useful analogies with all three. A drifting balloon is like a becalmed ship or a dead fish. It moves at the speed of the aerial fluid about it and the occupants perceive no movement whatever. The earth’s surface below appears to move in the opposite direction to that in which the wind carries the balloon. With a dirigible balloon or flying machine, the sensation is that of being exposed to a violent wind, against which (by observation of landmarks) we find that we progress. It is the same experience as that obtained when standing in an exposed position on a steamship, and we wonder if a bird or a fish gradually gets so accustomed to the opposing current as to be unconscious of it.

Looking over Windsor, the eye ranges far away till it loses itself in the hazy distance, to which the royal pile gives an aerial grace, while it adds majesty to the whole view. Looking up the river towards Hedsor the charming seat of Lord Boston, we have a prospect little less splendid, though of a different character. A vast extent of country lies at one’s feet, covered with dense wooded tracts, from which ever and anon peeps up an old grey tower; and the blue smoke marks a secluded village, while the glorious river winds away like a broad stream of molten silver.

Many parents say that the childhood years seemed to fly by all too quickly. One day their children are learning how to crawl, and suddenly it’s time to enroll them in their first year of school. Then, somehow they’ve learned how to read, swim, and ride a bicycle! A lifetime of memories can still be recalled like they happened only yesterday. From the parent’s perspective, it really wasn’t that long ago that their 18-year-olds were building sandcastles, and today they are fully-grown adults.

Working for myself would allow greater flexibility in terms of business hours and where I choose to conduct my work—such as out of my home, on the road, or at the neighborhood coffee shop—but staying in my current position gives me the opportunity to foster important professional relationships and learn from some of my more experienced colleagues. The company I work for now also provides me with a generous benefits package and up to three weeks of vacation every year. If I were to begin freelancing, vacation may not always be an option, especially if I’m trying to secure new clients. In addition, I may need to underbid my competitors to win contracts, which means I could be making less money, at least in the beginning. While this could be an exciting turning point in my career, this decision is one that requires careful evaluation.

I strode through the undergrowth that clothed the ridge behind the house, scarcely heeding where I went; passed on through the shadow of a thick cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond it, and so presently found myself some way on the other side of the ridge, and descending towards a streamlet that ran through a narrow valley. I paused and listened. The distance I had come, or the intervening masses of thicket, deadened any sound that might be coming from the enclosure. The air was still. Then with a rustle a rabbit emerged, and went scampering up the slope before me. I hesitated, and sat down in the edge of the shade.

On rare occasions, though, she decides to join the sirens to produce an ear-piercing accompaniment. Her howl starts out low, and then becomes increasingly high pitched like a tea kettle’s whistle. The neighbors don’t appreciate either the sirens or Annie’s imitation of them and have, on several occasions, hinted at their frustration with the noise. While I can’t stop Annie from reacting to the sirens, I can try to distract her with treats and toys when the trucks peel out of the station with sirens blaring.

Often elaborately decorated, antique fans have garnered the attention and fascination of many. When unfurled, their pleated folds reveal intricate bouquets of flowers, depictions of historic events, and bucolic scenes. The ebony or ivory sticks supporting these fans were often embellished with gilded vines or other designs that run vertically along each of the sticks. Braided silken cords in every imaginable shade allowed the fan to gently hang decoratively from one’s wrist when it wasn’t used for cooling. The most sumptuous fans were custom made as part of a grand ensemble worn for a major social occasion, such as a ball or dinner, and were designed to perfectly complement the user’s attire.

From 1918 to 1920, the sheep reduced lawn maintenance costs by keeping the grass short and providing fertilizer for the White House grounds. During the animals’ stay at the president’s home, their wool was auctioned off and the proceeds—almost $53,000—were donated to a charitable organization that brought humanitarian relief to soldiers fighting the war. Wilson’s flock of sheep was popular among the public, and some sheep were even given names, such as Old Ike, who was famous for his grouchy temperament. Though Wilson decided to sell the flock after just two years, the sheep had served their purpose—helping the Wilson family set an example for the entire nation.

During his twenties, Baum raised chickens, composed plays, ran a theater company, sold oil-based lubricants, and eventually relocated to Chicago to become a salesman for a glassware company. When traveling for his job, Baum invented stories to tell his children, and when Baum’s mother-in-law heard the tales, she persuaded him to publish the stories. These stories were published in his first book titled Mother Goose in Prose, which sold poorly when released in 1897.

The first step to glassblowing involves preparing the glass, which requires mixing silicon dioxide and other chemical components in a furnace heated to about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the glass in the furnace is ready, the glassblower dips a long iron or steel blowpipe into the hot glass. After the glob of hot glass is secured to the end of the rod, it is carried to a table with a smooth, flat, steel top, also known as a marver table. To shape the glass, the glassblower rolls the glass piece on the surface of the table. Next, the glassblower blows into the pipe to create a bubble inside the glass. To make the piece larger, the glassblower can gather more layers of glass from the furnace at this point. Once the piece is the desired size and shape, the glassblower will cut the glass off of the blowpipe, and then place it in an annealer that allows the piece to cool at a controlled rate.

According to the passage, which of the following steps should be done last?

Rohwedder was a Missouri-based jeweler who was determined to engineer a machine that would produce perfect slices. Before designing his machine, however, Rohwedder conducted research to help determine the ideal slice thickness for his prototype machine. Many blueprint sketches later, Rohwedder designed a slicing and wrapping machine that was bulky, yet efficient. While its size and price deterred many bakers from purchasing the machine at first, Rohwedder was able to convince a baker friend to take a chance on his invention. Within two weeks, the baker increased his bread sales substantially. In time, sliced bread achieved widespread popularity.

As illustrators, or would-be illustrators, your work is not at an end with the completion of your drawings; you must look after them while they are being engraved, and you should see them through the press. From the time you are given a commission to illustrate a subject until the printed result is in the hands of the public, the work in all its stages should be the object of your untiring attention. It is true that at present the fact that you take an interest in your profession will be counted against you in some quarters, for should you happen—as is not unlikely—to know more of drawing, engraving, and printing than the art editor, the engraver, or the printer, your suggestions will not be received with enthusiasm, nor your criticisms with delight.

The Colosseum, or Flavian Amphitheater, is a massive oval-shaped arena located in Rome that was used thousands of years ago for public performances, such as gladiator fights and re-enactments of famous battles. Construction of the Colosseum began during the reign of Emperor Vespasian and continued under the rule of his successors, Titus and Domitian. In 80 AD, after less than ten years of construction, Vespasian’s elder son, Titus, marked the opening of the arena by holding events for 100 days in a row. Construction continued with the addition of an upper gallery, built under the rule of Titus’s younger son, Domitian. The new gallery increased the arena’s seating capacity to an impressive fifty to eighty thousand spectators. Beneath the Colosseum, Domitian added a vast network of passages and rooms often connected to vertical shafts that provided quick access to the floor of the arena above. Although the use of the Colosseum largely ended in 404 AD under the reign of Emperor Honorius, one third of the original structure is still standing.

From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs—my nursery lore—to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.

Senet dates to around 3000 BC in Egypt. Like chess, this game involves two players, pawns, and a board divided into squares. However, while it may look a bit like chess, senet is a race game rather than a battle game, so its rules are much different. Liubo, on the other hand, was a battle game played in China around 1500 BC, but little is known about the rules of this board game. Another battle game, chaturanga, originated in India centuries ago. This game’s goal, similar to chess, is to capture or immobilize the opponent’s king, and each side’s army consists of elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers—or pawns. Chaturanga spread to Persia, China, and Japan and was known in these countries as shatranj, xianqui, and shogi, respectively. During the Middle Ages the game reached Europe, where it further evolved into the game we know today as chess.

Despite the congressional endorsement of the metric system in 1988, the United States remains the only industrialized country in the world that does not use the metric system as its primary system of measurement. With the exception of a few other nations, the rest of the world uses the metric system, formally known as the International System of Units, and for a very good reason. The metric system is simply easier to use. It uses decimals instead of fractions, and because all metric prefixes, such as milli-, centi-, deci-, and deca-, represent powers of 10, conversions between units require minimal mathematical skill. Moreover, in the metric system, a meter is exactly a meter anywhere on the globe, whereas the U.S. gallon, for example, differs from the British gallon.

Their lack of preparation was most marked and was probably the most effective cause of his initial success. After years of conflict they learned how to oppose him. From his own example they learned the value of organization and method in fighting, and from their own disasters they at last acquired the sense of union that was necessary to give him the final blow that made him no longer a menace to their national integrity.

And who or what are Brewer’s blackbirds? In the East, the purple and bronzed grackles, or crow blackbirds, are found in great abundance; but in Colorado these birds are replaced by Brewer’s blackbirds, which closely resemble their eastern kinsfolk, although not quite so large. The iridescence of the plumage is somewhat different in the two species, but in both the golden eye-balls show white at a distance. When I first saw a couple of Brewer’s blackbirds stalking featly about on a lawn at Manitou, digging worms and grubs out of the sod, I simply put them down in my notebook as bronzed or purple grackles—an error that had to be corrected afterwards, on more careful examination.

Highly recognizable due their distinctive coloration, they have reddish coats, a white ridge of hair running down their spines, and white eye rings that contrast with their dark faces. Both male and female red river hogs have squat, muscular bodies, and while both sexes have small, sharp tusks, the males typically have larger tusks than the females. Their keen senses of smell, sight, and hearing help them locate food sources, and their wedge-shaped heads and long snouts make it easy for them to uproot vegetation and uncover burrowing insects and small animals. When threatened, they can raise the hair on their faces and spines to make them appear larger and more intimidating. Very much social animals, they live in family groups composed of an adult male, several females, and their juvenile offspring.

According to the passage, red river hogs are easy to identify due to their

A.	tusks.
B.	coloration.
C.	muscular bodies.
D.	wedge-shaped heads.

These deer are easily recognizable by the tufts of dark hair that grow on their foreheads; however, the most startling feature of these otherwise docile-looking creatures are the fang-like upper canines that protrude from their mouths. The tufted deer has not been studied extensively in its natural habitat, but most researchers believe that their diet is limited to plants. Similarly, little is known about their longevity in the wild; however, we know from the few living in zoos that some have lived as long as fifteen years in captivity. Tufted deer bark when alarmed to warn others of their species of imminent danger. If cornered, they can use their upper canines to fight off predators. These animals are crepuscular—meaning they are more active at twilight—and typically prefer solitude over communal living.

According to the passage, which of the following statements about tufted deer is correct?

A.	They live for at least fifteen years.
B.	They have dark hair on their neck.
C.	They prefer communal living.
D.	They bark when alarmed.

Along with an unusually long neck, this herbivore also has large ears, large eyes, and a slender muzzle. The narrow muzzle allows the gerenuk to poke its head between thorny branches and bite off, with its disproportionately small mouth, plant leaves that provide precious moisture. Furthermore, due to extra vertebrae, strong hind legs, and wedge-shaped hooves, the gerenuk is the only antelope species that can stand unsupported on its hind legs. In this position, gerenuks are able to feed on leaves that are up to eight feet off the ground, giving them an advantage over the many other antelope species found in Africa.

According to the passage, gerenuks have unusually small

A.	legs.
B.	eyes.
C.	mouths.

Stone is the most durable, in the long run the cheapest, and as a consequence, the best material which can be furnished for the walls of a dwelling. With other farm buildings circumstances may govern differently; still, in many sections of the United States, even stone cannot be obtained, except at an expense and inconvenience altogether forbidding its use. Yet it is a happy relief that where stone is difficult, or not at all to be obtained, the best of clay for bricks, is abundant; and in almost all parts of our country, even where building timber is scarce, its transportation is so comparatively light, and the facilities of removing it are so cheap, that wood is accessible to everyone.

Several unsuccessful attempts had been made, resulting in the deaths of six pilots. Second, there was a cash prize involved, offered by New York City businessman Raymond Orteig to the first person to fly from New York to Paris—or Paris to New York—without stopping. Third, Lindbergh was not a high-profile aviator, but simply a pilot who transported mail; however, he had been trained in the Army Air Service Reserve and was regarded as a skilled and vigilant pilot. Finally, the trip was made in a custom single-engine monoplane with extra fuel tanks, named the Spirit of St. Louis, that Lindbergh helped design in preparation for the flight. Taking off from Roosevelt Field on May 20, Lindbergh traveled more than 3,600 miles in just over thirty-three hours and landed safely in Paris on May 21, earning the prize money and instant fame.

At the mint, circles of the exact right size are punched out of thin strips of metal, heated in a furnace, and then washed and dried. Before the coins are stamped, they are rolled through a machine that gives them uniformly thick, smooth edges. Then the coins are imprinted with the appropriate words and images on both sides. Some coins, like U.S. quarters, are given ridged edges—a step initially done to prevent illegal removal of precious metal when coins were gold and silver. After careful inspection, coins are counted and bagged for transportation; coins with flaws are removed and recycled. Only after confirming that the bags of coins weigh the correct amount are they shipped to the Federal Reserve Bank to begin circulation.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	quality control steps in coin minting.
B.	transportation of finished coins.

Even during the off season, our narrow, winding roads have trouble accommodating the large vehicles and trucks that increase in number each year as the population grows. A switching yard and railroad tracks run through the middle of town, and traffic is at its worst when long freight trains pass through, causing traffic to back up in all directions. Summertime brings an influx of tourists heading to the wilderness areas at the top of the pass, and in the fall, the annual Oktoberfest and the film festival attract yet more visitors. Most of the locals opt to stay home rather than brave the traffic to attend these events. In winter, when the snow piles up in drifts, skiers and snowboarders flock to the ski area, using our town as a home base. Though tourism boosts the local economy and many railroad employees live here, it is clear that the city needs some help alleviating its traffic problems.

Even sitting on the front porch steps of my apartment building with my morning cereal qualifies, and it certainly is the most convenient location. Sometimes on workdays, I’ll eat my lunch while sitting on the bus stop bench. However, my most memorable picnics happen when I’m traveling by car. I’ll often pull over at a historical marker along the roadside and get a free history lesson while munching on a snack. Another picnic spot that is educational, and one that is often overlooked, is a sculpture garden. Many such places welcome picnickers and provide seating within a few feet of works of art. Yet not all picnic spots are ideal. My least favorite location for a picnic is on a summer beach, since it’s often difficult to have an enjoyable meal while battling the crowds, heat, and blowing sand.

Indeed, many of Joni’s neighbors believed that Sheba, a 115-pound mastiff, was a veritable terror, especially when the dog jumped up and planted her huge paws on top of the gate whenever the postal carrier stopped to deliver the mail. Just then, Joni noticed the dog was standing very still. Then she watched as Sheba tilted her head slowly from one side to the other. Soon Joni recognized the familiar sound of sirens drawing near. In that moment, the dog looked upwards toward the sky and howled. Once the sirens faded, Sheba bowed down in the tall grass and wagged her tail back and forth. Then apparently fatigued from the morning’s activities, Sheba ignored a passing cyclist and retreated to the corner of the yard where she flopped down in the shade of an ancient oak tree.

It was snowing steadily the morning I was to meet a new client who had an ice cream shop. When I stepped through the door, the client greeted me with panic in his eyes. The shop’s secondhand freezer had stopped working the night before, and a month’s supply of precious handmade ice cream was beginning to thaw. The owner thought he should close up shop until our freezer could be delivered. One of his employees suggested they donate the ice cream to a charity right away. I had the phone number of the appliance warehouse supervisor, but I feared a replacement freezer would not arrive soon enough to transfer the ice cream to it. I turned toward the window and eyed the fresh snow; it had already piled up to the wheel rims of my truck. It was an unconventional solution, but it might just work for the short term.

Because the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand, is built on land that is subject to strong earthquakes, several important techniques were used in the museum’s design and construction phases. One technique is that the museum rests upon base isolators—rubber pads laminated with steel and containing columns of energy-absorbing lead. The base isolators serve to decouple the building from the ground motion when an earthquake hits. This means the building still moves, but it sustains less damage during an earthquake than it would if it had a traditional fixed foundation. The isolators thus help protect museum visitors and minimize damage to the building’s contents. The museum even allows public access to some of the base isolators, featuring them as one of the museum’s exhibits. Today, many other nations around the world have implemented base isolation, and the systems continue to evolve as the technology matures.

According to the passage, the function of base isolators in the Te Papa museum is to 

A.	control ground movement.
B.	prevent structural movement.

The most careful study and analysis have shown that almost every known food has some peculiar advantage, such as digestibility, or cheapness, or pleasant taste as flavoring for other more nutritious, but less interesting, foods. But some foods have much higher degrees of nutritiousness or digestibility or wholesomeness than others; so that our problem is to pick out from a number of foods that “taste good” to us, those which are the most nutritious, the most digestible, and the most wholesome, and to see that we get plenty of them. It is not that certain foods, or classes of food, are “good,” and should be eaten to the exclusion of all others; nor that certain foods, or classes of food, are “bad,” and should be excluded from our tables entirely; but that certain foods are more nutritious, or more wholesome, than others; and that it is best to see that we get plenty of the former before indulging our appetites upon the latter.

One such ban was intended to save wax paper, although it could conceivably conserve steel and wheat as well. When the ban on this item took effect in 1943, U.S. citizens faced a crisis of convenience. The absence of the item would burden many homemakers. What was the item? Pre-sliced bread! The thinking was that packaging for a ready-sliced loaf, to prevent it from drying out, required heavier wax paper than for an unsliced loaf. Less demand for bread slicing machines would potentially also reduce the use of steel, and perhaps wheat would be conserved because bread sales might decrease as a result of the ban. In the beginning, government officials issued stern warnings to bakeries about dissenting. However, the government eventually bowed to public pressure and lifted the prohibition three months later.

According to the passage, the government instituted a ban lasting three months on

After several weeks, I realized that, of all the vegetables I had planted, the tomato plants at the end of the planter were the fastest growing and the healthiest looking. Since all the plants received water and fertilizer on a regular basis, and since they were all planted in the same type of soil, I deduced that some of the plants were distressed because they were at the shady end of the planter. It turned out that the backyard fence shaded most of the planter in the afternoon. With this in mind, I transplanted the struggling plants into containers and moved them out of the shade, and soon all of the vegetables were showing promise.

She started with the ones she could easily identify and then worked outward, looking for other noticeable patterns of stars. It was a perfect night and she didn’t feel like heading home just yet. Then she noticed a hazy patch of sky in which no stars were visible and realized that clouds were swiftly moving in. Anjali felt a cool breeze in the air that suggested rain was on the way. Anjali knew she should head for the car or risk getting drenched, but then again, maybe the rain wouldn’t amount to much and the sky would clear up. She didn’t want to return home if she didn’t have to. Perhaps she should just stay put and brave the rain if it did come. She could also go to her car and return with the umbrella from the trunk. Conflicted, Anjali looked around, and for the first time, noticed a large sycamore tree nearby. She breathed a sigh of relief as she made up her mind.

Based on the passage, Anjali will most likely

A.	stay put.

Amory had lately received several alarming letters from Mr. Barton—the Lake Geneva house was too large to be easily rented; the best rent obtainable at present would serve this year to little more than pay for the taxes and necessary improvements; in fact, the lawyer suggested that the whole property was simply a white elephant on Amory’s hands. Nevertheless, even though it might not yield a cent for the next three years, Amory decided with a vague sentimentality that for the present, at any rate, he would not sell the house.

Unlike their lookalikes—specifically the Cassin’s finch, which has a peaked crown and a straight-topped bill, and the purple finch, a bird of a deeper, more rosy-purple hue—house finches have slender bodies and thick, slightly curved beaks, as well as flat heads and short wings. An adult male house finch is most often identified by its red forehead, chest, and rump, while the adult female has a more inconspicuous gray-brown color with indistinct streaks running down the body. As the house finch becomes more common in different areas of North America, it continues to capture the hearts of bird watchers with its attention-grabbing physical traits and long, warbling song.

Though the word “cardboard” is used to describe material for a variety of sturdy products made to ship and store items, corrugated fiberboard and paperboard are the two primary types of this material. Patented in 1856, corrugated fiberboard was originally used to line tall hats. Typically, this material is composed of two pieces of sturdy, flat cardboard, with a wavy corrugated strip running through the middle. It is used to ship a majority of all products in the United States these days, and it is what most people imagine when they think of a cardboard box. Paperboard, on the other hand, is stiff, flattened paper. It is commonly used for lighter-duty packaging such as cereal and snack-food boxes. While corrugated fiberboard has a greater recycling value than paperboard, both materials are widely recycled and biodegradable, thereby adding to their appeal and utility.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Corrugated fiberboard was patented during the nineteenth century.
B.	Corrugated fiberboard is used mostly for lighter-duty packaging.

But certain it is, that, before they reached any place of rest, their splendid garments were quite worn out. They all looked very much travel-stained, and would have had the dust of many countries on their shoes, if the streams, through which they waded, had not washed it all away.

The warm, mellow September sunshine was streaming over the irregular roofs and twisted chimneys of the little town of Chagmouth, and was glinting on the water in the harbor, and sending gleaming, straggling, silver lines over the deep reflections of the shipping moored by the side of the jetty. The rising tide, lapping slowly and gently in from the ocean, was floating the boats beached on the shingle, and was gradually driving back the crowd of barefooted children who had ventured out in search of mussels, and was sending them, shrieking with mirth, scampering up the seaweed-covered steps that led to the fish market.

Born in England in 1899, Hitchcock described his childhood as lonely and sheltered. After developing an interest in photography, Hitchcock started working in film production in 1920. Hitchcock directed his first film, Mrs. Peabody, in 1922, and his first film as solo director was The Pleasure Garden, released in 1925. Hitchcock went on to direct many acclaimed films such as Rebecca, Spellbound, Notorious, Strangers on a Train, and Rear Window. Perhaps Hitchcock’s greatest strength was his technical dexterity, such as his revolutionary editing and use of effective soundtracks.

George Ohrstrom, Walter Chrysler, and the team of John Raskob and Al Smith vied to capture the title for their respective buildings. Originally, the competition had been primarily between Ohrstrom and Chrysler. Ohrstrom raced to complete his 927-foot-tall bank building at 40 Wall Street before Chrysler’s building was finished, only to have Chrysler erect a stainless steel spire, increasing the Chrysler Building’s height from 925 feet to 1,046 feet. After learning of Chrysler’s spire, Raskob and Smith had their architects—Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon—modify the initial plan and make their skyscraper, the Empire State Building, even taller than its originally planned 1,000 feet. Over the course of a mere twenty months, the Empire State Building was completed, standing at an impressive height of 1,250 feet.

In 1911, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was opened for business at a time when Indiana’s car industry was expanding. The speedway’s initial purpose was to serve as a testing ground for car manufacturers and to give potential car buyers the chance to compare models. When the first Indy 500 race took place, it drew the attention of people all over the nation. In fact, within only a few years of the inaugural race, the track turned into such an economic hotspot that it gave rise to a new residential community—Speedway, Indiana—in the surrounding area.

A central point of his reforms was the institution of individual political responsibility based on residency in a region rather than on heredity or membership in a clan. Moreover, Cleisthenes’s form of democracy was divided into three institutions: the assembly, which wrote the laws; a council that included representatives who were each appointed from different newly-formed townships; and a court system. In less than 50 years, this early form of democracy was further developed under the leadership of Pericles. Pericles argued that people in certain public service positions should be paid, to encourage inclusion in government of people outside the wealthy class. Cleisthenes’s democratic ideals continued to evolve and still serve as inspiration for countries around the world.

According to the passage, Cleisthenes’s reforms encouraged the

A.	dissolution of familial clans.

There is, at any rate, one privilege that the autograph collector alone enjoys. It is difficult to say that any particular piece of china, medal, coin, print, or postage stamp is unique. There is always the danger of a duplicate turning up. With autograph letters, on the other hand, each specimen may fairly be described as “absolutely unique.” I have only once met with an exception to this rule. Some twenty days before his death Charles Dickens wrote a letter in duplicate to Buckstone the actor. To avoid the possibility of its miscarrying one was addressed to the theatre, and the other to Sydenham.

In order to offer the least possible resistance to the water when the animal is swimming below the surface, the otter’s head and muzzle are flattened, and the ears are very small. Both ears and nostrils can be closed to exclude the water. The body is long, low, and sinuous in movement, set upon short legs which are loosely articulated. The feet are palmate, with five toes armed with short, non-retractile claws, and perfect interdigital webs.

Iron and steel can be joined by heating until they become plastic and then consolidating the two members of the joint by hammer blows, the work being supported on an anvil. Correct heat and cleanliness are the chief requisites. The “welding heat” corresponds with that temperature at which the metal is in a state of partial fusion on the surface. The better the quality of the iron, the higher the temperature it can stand without being burned and ruined. Iron at a welding heat gives off dazzling sparks, whereas ordinary cast steel is only an intense yellow, but few sparks being evolved.… When heated in a perfectly clear fire, the metal may need no treatment prior to hammering; but otherwise it may be necessary to sprinkle sand or some special flux over the work.

The ancient Egyptians used sails to navigate the Nile River as early as 3000 BC. Due to the predictable wind direction, large sails could be used to travel upstream on the river, against the current but in the direction of the wind. The Egyptians also used sails on their oceangoing vessels on the Mediterranean Sea. These sailboats contributed greatly to the success of the civilization by facilitating transportation to and trade with distant population centers that were impractical to reach by land. In addition to commerce and transportation, sailboats were also used for fishing and warfare. Like its land counterpart, the wheel, the sail is an indispensable invention that changed the course of history.

About 1770 there began in German literary life a curious movement called “Sturm und Drang” (storm and pressure). Almost all young writers were under its influence. Its most prominent quality was discontent with the existing world. The critical guide of the movement was Herder. To him is due the impulse which led to a collection of the songs and ballads of the people. His most important prose work was “Ideas Toward the Philosophy of the History of Humanity.” To Herder belongs the honor of stimulating the genius of Goethe, who holds in German literature the place of Shakespeare in English. His extraordinary range of activity is his most wonderful characteristic.

Located on Coney Island, New York, the wooden roller coaster opened in the late 1800s and attracted thrill-seekers and spectators from far and wide. The coaster sent riders, two per car, up a high lift hill—the first and tallest hill of a roller coaster—and then down a steep slope and around a 25-foot circular loop, subjecting riders to intense gravitational forces. Despite its initial success, most people who were brave enough to try it once did not dare ride it again, and some were even injured. Over time, this roller coaster became less popular and, ultimately, unprofitable, shutting down permanently in 1902. Although the Flip-Flap Railway inspired many imitators, it wasn’t until the 1970s that the looping model was perfected. Circular loops were abandoned in favor of elliptical loops, which kept the gravitational forces low and increased passenger safety.

In addition to their collection of poetry titled Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, which they coauthored and pseudonymously published in 1846, each of the sisters has at least one classic novel to her name. In 1847, Charlotte published Jane Eyre, her first literary masterpiece. Two months later, Anne published Agnes Grey, which was soon overshadowed by Emily’s first and only novel, Wuthering Heights, published later that month. Not to be outdone, Anne published her second and last novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, the following June. Although Anne’s second novel was a commercial success, it received many negative critical reviews—even Charlotte made disparaging comments about it. However, critics today consider the novel an important milestone in feminist literature.

As to the best time for a visit, that depends partly on which aspect of the Island is to be sought, not to say on circumstances and opportunity; but to my mind it wears its fairest face in its dullest season, when its hotel-keepers see cause to take their own holiday. Then, in early summer, flocks of sheep-like tourists miss seeing at their freshest and richest the clumps of umbrageous foliage, the hedgerows and copses sweet with gay blossoms, the turfy slopes spangled with wild flowers, the glowing meadows, the blooming cottage plots, the “weeds of glorious feature,” and in short, all the charms that make this one of “the gardens of England,” in which, exclaims Oliver Wendell Holmes, “everything grows with such a lavish extravagance of greenery that it seems as if it must bankrupt the soil before autumn.”

The Yosemite Creek descends to the valley floor in three leaps, with a total height of about 2,500 feet. …The upper fall has a vertical descent of 1,430 feet; the middle fall consists of a series of cascades, with a total descent of 626 feet; while the lower fall is 320 feet high. At the top the Yosemite Falls is about 35 feet wide. As the season advances and the volume of water decreases, the fall dwindles considerably. At its best, however, it is one of the grandest features of the Valley. In winter a splendid ice cone, 500 feet high, forms at the foot of the upper fall.

In discussing Yosemite Falls, the author’s primary focus is on its

A.	height.

2878.	Amateur radio operators called “hams” are private citizens who use transmitters and receivers to communicate with other hams at various locations around the world. In the wake of the 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic, United States legislation established the Amateur Radio Service, a team of radio operators who provide backup communication during crisis situations. Over one hundred years later, there are over 700,000 licensed operators in the U.S., and their knowledge of radio communication has many practical benefits. Communication by ham radio is advantageous because, unlike cellular phones, these devices do not operate on any private or public communications infrastructure, which can become overloaded or inoperable in the event of an emergency. Today, twenty-seven small frequency radio bands are reserved exclusively for ham radios and are available internationally from almost anywhere—from high on a mountaintop to the middle of a crowded city.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	reliability of hams during an emergency situation.
B.	value of licensure for ham radio operators.
C.	small frequency bands allocated to hams.
D.	history of hams in crisis situations.

Several theories have emerged regarding potential predecessor terms in languages such as Scottish, Greek, Choctaw, and French. Another theory is that the phrase was invented by Obediah Kelly, a railroad worker who would write his initials on packages he would transport by train. While some of these theories seem plausible, the most likely genesis of the term is the phrase “oll korrect,” which is an ironic spelling of “all correct,” a common phrase in the United States during the 1830s. The term’s status in the American lexicon was further solidified when President Martin Van Buren—whose nickname was “Old Kinderhook”—formed the OK Club for his supporters in the 1840s.

In discussing the term OK, the author’s primary focus is on its

A.	origin.

Gladiatorial combats were not native to Rome, but had long been known in Etruria as an adjunct to funeral ceremonies, and were probably introduced thence into Rome by way of Campania, where the amphitheater of Pompeii is the oldest in existence. The first show of gladiators at Rome took place in 264 BC, but only three pairs of combatants were engaged in it. In course of time the number of gladiators increased, and such contests were given with greater frequency, although they remained a mere accompaniment of funeral ceremonies until 105 BC, in which year they were for the first time offered as official amusements to the people. During the empire, gladiatorial shows were organized on a vast scale, and amphitheaters were built in all the provinces.

No conception of the beauties of the jellyfish can be formed from pictures, or from the stranded “sunfishes” found along the shore at low tide. In the water they move along or swim by the slow pumping or rising and falling of the umbrella or disk, and are of all the colors of the rainbow. Some, like the dark, lavender-splashed specimens, can be seen from a long distance, while others are almost invisible, in fact, are like glass or crystal, and interpose no obstacle to other forms beyond.

To prepare for her two-day trek, she first checked the weather forecast so she could pack the appropriate clothing and gear. The meteorologist predicted light rain over the weekend, so Jaelyn laid out rain gear including her parka, rain pants, and waterproof gaiters. Then she stocked her bear canister with her favorite lightweight, nonperishable foods: granola bars, nuts, instant soup, and a dehydrated dinner. Afterwards, she visited the outdoor sports store to purchase a new tent, batteries for her flashlight, and trekking poles. When she got home, she strapped her tent to the pack, put the bear canister in the bottom of the main compartment, and placed her sleeping bag and clothes on top. Next she packed her toiletries and first aid items in the side pockets of her backpack and loaded it into her car. The next morning, Jaelyn woke up early to drive to the trailhead; she was excited about her first hike in the Midwest.

At the top of the mean street on which Margaret’s house was situated, and looking down upon its meaner neighbors in much the same way that its mistress looked upon the denizens of the street, stood Miss Prime’s cottage. It was not on the mean street,—it would have disdained to be,—but sat exactly facing it in prim watchfulness over the unsavory thoroughfare which ran at right angles. The cottage was one and a half stories in height, and the upper half-story had two windows in front that looked out like a pair of accusing eyes. It was painted a dull lead color.

Aurelius stood in his laboratory one June morning, balancing a moneybag in his chubby pink palm. He seemed tickled by some subtlety of thought, and wonderfully well pleased with his own good humor. He smiled, locked the moneybag in a drawer that stood in a confidential cupboard, and, taking his cap and walking staff, repaired to the street. Pacing the narrow pavement like a veritable potentate, pretentious as any peacock, yet mightily amiable from the superb self-satisfaction that roared in him like a furnace, he acknowledged the greetings of passers-by with the elevation of a hand, a solemn movement of the head. It was well to seem unutterably serious when under the eyes of the mob.

But it was eminently respectable, and in its way imposing. It seemed to say that the glittering shops of the jewelers, the milliners, the confectioners, the florists, the picture-dealers, the furriers, the makers of rare and costly antiquities, retail traders in luxuries of life, were beneath the notice of a house that had its foundations in the high finance, and was built literally and figuratively in the shadow of St. Petronius’ Church.

Subterranean ice was brought to my notice by a mere accident, late in the month of September, 1877, while on a descent of King’s Ravine, on Mount Adams, in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. We had just descended the rock wall of the mountain and had reached the head of the gorge, when my companion, Mr. Charles E. Lowe, the well-known Appalachian guide of Randolph, suddenly said to me, “Would you like a piece of ice? I can get you some presently.” I answered, “Certainly,” wondering where he would find any. When we got among the big boulders, which form so rough a path for the traveler at the bottom of the ravine, Mr. Lowe climbed down under one of the biggest, and presently reappeared with a good sized lump of ice. I was much impressed at finding ice at the end of the summer in this gorge, when for months past no ice or snow had been visible on the surrounding mountains.

The ordinary pictures of Jaffa do it ample justice.

And since each individual has a distinct personality it is advisable for everyone to select the type of dancing best suited to that personality.

When Mr. Irving’s art is discussed, when his Hamlet or his Mathias, his Shylock or his Dei Franchi, are discussed, he should be regarded from a broader standpoint than that of the mere actor. He is entitled to be looked at as not only the central figure of the play, but as the motive power of the whole entertainment,—the master who has set the story and grouped it, the controlling genius of the moving picture, the source of the inspiration of the painter, the musician, the costumer, and the machinist, whose combined efforts go to the realization of the actor-manager’s conception and plans. It is acknowledged on all hands that Mr. Irving has done more for dramatic art all round than any actor of our time; and it is open to serious question whether any artist of any time has done as much.

As I trekked down the stairs for a better look, I wondered if the marks might have been made by large sand crabs or by the spiny-tailed iguanas common in this area. Most likely, they were just tire tracks from the beach patrol, but I had to check them out. After looking more closely, I discovered what was responsible for the design in the sand.

Although relieved that he had not stumbled upon a mountain lion or a bear, Todd was nevertheless startled by his unexpected encounter with an animal that appeared to weigh about 200 pounds. Since the deer had not yet seen him, Todd had plenty of time to study it. The deer had ten-point antlers, which Todd guessed meant he was fully mature. Looking at the huge antlers, Todd found it particularly incredible that, unlike cattle whose horns are permanent, male deer shed and regrow their antlers annually. He watched the deer eat, taking note of the speed with which the deer consumed the tough grass. Todd began to slowly step backwards, but by then, the deer had noticed him and with three graceful bounds, disappeared into the trees.

Our train entered the Bad Lands of North Dakota in the early evening twilight, and the President stood on the rear platform of his car, gazing wistfully upon the scene. “I know all this country like a book,” he said. “I have ridden over it, and hunted over it, and tramped over it, in all seasons and weather, and it looks like home to me. My old ranch is not far off. We shall soon reach Medora, which was my station.” It was plain to see that that strange, forbidding-looking landscape, hills and valleys to Eastern eyes utterly demoralized and gone to the bad,—flayed, fantastic, treeless, a riot of naked clay slopes, chimney-like buttes, and dry coulees,—was in his eyes a land of almost pathetic interest. There were streaks of good pasturage here and there where his cattle used to graze, and where the deer and the pronghorn used to linger.

Which of the following statements about President Roosevelt does the passage suggest?

A.	He enjoyed living on his old ranch.
B.	He had traveled to visit his new ranch.
C.	He returned to his old ranch frequently.
D.	He was accompanied by a fellow rancher.

I tried to ignore his gaze, but his longing became a tangible presence in the room, making it difficult to concentrate on my meal. Sitting on his haunches, Baxter vigilantly eyed the chicken as I slowly pierced a small piece with my fork, lifted it up, and placed it in my mouth. He wagged his tail and was close enough that I could feel his warm breath on my shin. Guiltily admitting defeat once again, I made Baxter perform a few tricks from obedience class before scraping the last bits of my lunch into his bowl. Satisfied that the excitement was over, he circled up on the rug and fell asleep.

A.	The author has a habit of giving Baxter table scraps.
B.	The author dislikes eating meals when Baxter is around.
C.	The author gave Baxter the fruit rather than the grilled chicken.

In the early years, this tenacity helped me convince my parents to let me do things like go on a camping trip with a friend’s family when I was only four years old or learn to ride a bike in just a week. As a young adult, I pursued my dream summer job doggedly until the manager of the theme park relented and hired me. As I matured, my goals required dedication and commitment over longer periods of time, enabling me to plan for a leave of absence from work for an extensive trip to explore our national parks. I’m not sure what the next objective in my life will be, but I am certain that I will approach it with steadfast resolve.

He was preparing to retire in just a few weeks, and as his last day at work drew near, he reflected on his experience at the esteemed publishing house. Bernard began working there as a fact checker and over time became associate editor, senior editor, and eventually editor-in-chief. Bernard smiled at the memory of the promotion party his fellow editors organized when they heard he would be their new supervisor. He thought about his workmates and appreciated how many of them had become dear friends. In fact, Bernard recalled, if it weren’t for this job, he would have never met his wife, who had been a freelance photographer during Bernard’s early days with the publisher. A tentative voice intruded on his thoughts, and Bernard remembered he still had some work to do and some fond farewells to make before officially retiring.

It is well known to all who are acquainted with the history of geology that the static conception of the earth—the idea that its existing condition is the finished product of forces no longer in action—led to prejudices which have long retarded, and indeed still retard, the progress of that science. This fact indicates that at the outset of a student’s work in this field he should be guarded against such misconceptions. The only way to attain the end is by bringing to the understanding of the beginner a clear idea of successions of events which are caused by the forces operating in and on this sphere. Of all the chapters of this great story, that which relates to the history of the work done by the heat of the sun is the most interesting and awakening.

In discussing the study of geology, the author’s primary focus is on 

A.	correcting a false notion about the earth’s condition.
B.	achievements in the study of the earth’s condition.
C.	identifying forces that affect the earth.

Each year, Mitch and a couple of his friends would launch at the Junction City Bridge and travel sixty-five miles downstream to the bridge at Maple Hill. The lazy river offered many sandbars for campsites near the solitude of the open prairie. The group prided themselves on cooking a good dinner at the end of each day—so much so that they held camp cook-off contests to see who could prepare the most delicious camp meal. By day, they often amused themselves by batting an empty plastic water jug back and forth with their paddle blades while floating through the calmer sections. They also allowed plenty of time to explore along the river’s edge and inland wherever they saw some interesting terrain. Mitch’s favorite part about these trips, though, was spotting the abundant wildlife along the way such as beaver, mink, and bald eagles.

Traffic, business, industry,—the work of the world was going forward. A huge lumber boat blocked the river at the bridge, and while the tugs pushed it slowly through the draw, I stood and gazed at the busy tracks in the railroad yards below me, at the line of high warehouses along the river. I, too, was a part of this. The thought of my brain, the labor of my body, the will within me, had gone to the making of this world.

He wrote several poems on his own but struggled with the process. Seeking outside support and feedback, he joined a creative writing group. The group members praised his ideas and provided him with the honest, constructive criticism he needed. Over the course of the next year, Treyvon tried writing short stories and even dabbled in playwriting, but he excelled at poetry, which remained his true passion. In addition to hours of practice, he also honed his craft by studying the work of famous poets, and he met a few published writers who encouraged him to put together a collection of his poetry. The booklet was well received at his local bookstore, and in time Treyvon was giving poetry readings.

The origin of the parasol is wrapped in considerable obscurity. Some profound investigators have supposed that large leaves tied to the branching extremities of a bough suggested the first idea of the invention. Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent, which remains in form unaltered to the present day. Dr. Morrison, however, tells us that the tradition existing in China is, that the San, which signifies a shade for sun and rain, originated in standards and banners waving in the air. As this is a case in which we may quote the line—“Who shall decide when doctors disagree?”—we may with safety assume that all are in the right, and that the parasol owed its origin to all or any of the above-mentioned fortuitous circumstances.

Though you asked only about the size and material options we have available, there are other factors to keep in mind when planning a recreational billiard room. The room size, including space for clearance around the table, is a critical first consideration, but another concern you should be aware of is lighting. The lighting system above the table should be installed before delivery of the table, and the fixture should be adequately bright and at a height that minimizes the chance for damage by teens handling the pool cues. If your new facility also includes a study area for teens, you may want to include noise abatement features in the billiard room. Finally, before ordering the table and arranging for its installation, you will need to confirm there is a path with enough clearance, and without obstacles such as a staircase, from the parking lot to the billiard room.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

The diamond’s history can be traced back to Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a French merchant, who bought the crudely cut gem and sold it to King Louis XIV in 1668. At the request of the king, Sieur Pitau, the court jeweler, recut the 112 3/16-carat diamond. Due to its unique color, the resulting 67 1/8-carat stone became known as the French Blue. The French government acquired the gem during the French Revolution, but the jewel was stolen and disappeared for years. In 1812, a blue diamond weighing 45.52 carats, believed to be recut from the French Blue, resurfaced briefly in London. The next documentation of its ownership appeared in an 1839 catalog of Henry Philip Hope’s possessions. The diamond remained in the Hope family until 1901, and it first came to the United States with its owner Evalyn Walsh McLean.

Miller, submitted a research report to the War Department recommending camels for carrying loads through terrain that was often too rugged and arid for horses and mules. Crosman’s suggestion languished, however, until another camel supporter, Major Henry C. Wayne, reintroduced the idea. In 1847, Wayne delivered a report to Congress and the War Department recommending that the military import camels. Mississippi’s Senator Jefferson Davis supported the idea, and when he was later appointed Secretary of War, Davis used his position to present the idea to the president and Congress. Finally, in 1855, Congress passed the Shield amendment, which allowed for the purchase of camels for military use. One year and much difficulty later, a ship carrying the first load of thirty-five camels landed safely in Texas.

Next, collect all the other necessary materials—window screening, an old wooden picture frame, an old blender, felt, a stapler, and a tub large enough to hold the frame. Tear the used paper into small pieces and place the pieces into a blender. Add warm water and blend. Once the pulp is thoroughly blended, construct a mold by stretching the screening material tightly over the frame and stapling around the edges. Add the paper pulp and some water to the tub, pour in a little liquid starch, and stir. Submerge the mold in the tub, hold it level, and gently shake it to make sure the pulp mixture covers the mold evenly across the screen. Then, lift the mold above the water level and wait for most of the water to drain. Finally, place the mold on top of a square of felt and gently press the pulp onto the felt to dry.

Based on the passage, what should be done just after blending the pulp?

A.	Construct a mold.

The latter option is not too tough, if you have some tools and review a how-to video before following these steps. First, close the hot and cold water supply lines under the sink, and then remove the faucet handle screws and the handles. Next, unscrew the large retaining nut at the base of each cartridge. To remove the cartridges, grasp each cartridge post with pliers and pull straight up. Set the cartridges aside and use a small screwdriver to remove the rubber valve seats and springs—located in the recesses where the cartridges were seated—and discard them. Put in place new springs and valve seats. Before starting the reassembly, apply a thin layer of plumber’s grease around each cartridge. When the reassembly is complete, open the water supply lines. If the faucet still leaks, you need to replace the old cartridges with new ones.

Mason’s jars were quite different from other canning equipment of the day, which involved nontransparent glass containers and seals made of cork and wax that would often fail. Mason’s clear glass jar had a threaded neck to accommodate a screw-on lid that self-sealed as the hot contents cooled inside the jar. During World War II, Mason jars were especially useful when the government instituted food rations and encouraged Americans to cultivate gardens and preserve what they grew. Yet, despite the jars’ success, their popularity waned in the postwar 1950s as farmers began to freeze their harvests and more people acquired refrigerators.

Which of the following statements does the passage suggest?

Lee thought about all the guests who were coming. Several of them had good reasons to celebrate, including his sister Kimberley, who was married last month, and his brother Greg, who recently received a promotion. There was also his good friend Jill, who had completed her first marathon last week. Although Lee was delighted with their achievements, he was most proud of his wife Mallory, who had just returned from her first military deployment. Mallory had been gone for seven months, and now that she was home, Lee wanted to bring everyone together to help her catch up on all she had missed while she was away. As he put the cake in the oven, Lee hoped that it, and the party, would turn out to be a great success.

An attempt at Philosophic Dialogue may seem to demand a word of explanation, if not of apology. For, it may be said, the Dialogue is a literary form not only exceedingly difficult to handle, but, in its application to philosophy, discredited by a long series of failures. I am not indifferent to this warning; yet I cannot but think that I have chosen the form best suited to my purpose. For, in the first place, the problems I have undertaken to discuss have an interest not only philosophic but practical; and I was ambitious to treat them in a way which might perhaps appeal to some readers who are not professed students of philosophy.

Which of the following best restates the author’s main point about the use of dialogue?

A.	It appeals to some but not all readers.
B.	It is a form the author knows can be difficult.
C.	It is usually not successful when applied to philosophy.
D.	It is the most appropriate form for the author’s purpose.

I must admit that my personal reaction, when I first received a floral delivery that included several silk flowers in addition to the fresh flowers and greens, was disappointment. I was also initially bothered when centerpiece patterns featuring solely human- or machine-made blooms began to dominate the craft stores. One pattern for a winter arrangement called for artificial blossoms of a variety that blooms in summer only, which I thought was ridiculous. But over time, I have come to appreciate the practicality of these synthetic flowers. They are less expensive compared to live flowers, because they last so long, and they offer a much wider variety of options than may be available at the local supermarket or florist. I am now quite tolerant of any floral arrangement, regardless of material, designed with attention to color and quality.

Based on the passage, the author’s present attitude toward artificial flowers is

A.	amused.
B.	annoyed.
C.	accepting.

The responsibility for upwards of 300 pages in print is a burden which my unaccustomed conscience cannot easily bear, and by accepting it I lose forever the unassailable dignity of private criticism. In these circumstances I approach my readers in an apologetic frame of mind. I shall not apologize for writing a dull book by explaining in what manner it is interesting. I had thought of doing something of the sort, but at the present moment that course presents insuperable difficulties. An explanation, if not apology, is however necessary; for this volume is in one sense a compromise. It is less than a biography and more than an essay. It aims at being not a complete Life of Boswell, but an explanation of his character.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	state the intent of the book.
B.	compare the book to an essay.
C.	defend the quality of the book.

Waddell, and Alexander Majors launched the business to relay communication more quickly between people living in the Midwest and west coast of the United States. The first trip made by the Pony Express was from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California. The riders would switch to a new horse about every 15 miles and passed their cargo to a new courier every 75 to 100 miles. The types of mail sent by Pony Express were mainly business documents, newspaper reports, and government messages, and the average delivery time was 10 days. This was very impressive given that delivery of mail by stagecoach took 25 days and by ship could take several months. Despite its initial success, the Pony Express did not survive long after the completion of the Pacific Telegraph line.

As a young child, Dali showed artistic promise and received a great deal of support from his parents, who built him a studio and sent him to various art schools. Dali was not a model student, however, and was expelled from an art college in Madrid in 1926. During the next few years, Dali met artists and others who influenced his development as a painter. He was exposed to Cubism through his interactions with the artist Pablo Picasso, and he was introduced to Surrealism by Joan Miro, Paul Eluard, and René Magritte. Moreover, Dali was heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theories, which guided a method he used to tap into his subconscious mind and enhance his creativity. Using this method, Dali rendered his dreams and subconscious thoughts on the canvas, creating iconic works of art that established him as one of the most famous surrealist painters of his generation.

Laura Ingalls Wilder was the author of the beloved Little House children’s books series, which provided autobiographical accounts of Wilder’s life in the Midwestern United States during the late 1800s. Born in 1867, Wilder lived with her family in a log cabin in rural Wisconsin. After moving around the Midwest, Wilder and her family settled in South Dakota, where she became a teacher in 1882. However, Wilder later married and eventually left the profession to help raise her children and work on the farm with her husband. Despite their popularity today, Wilder’s iconic Little House books might not have been written without the encouragement of her daughter, a reporter. Though Wilder’s first draft was turned down by publishers, perhaps due to the economic downfall of the Great Depression, she reworked the book—changing the title from Pioneer Girl to Little House and gearing it toward a younger audience. Since then, Wilder’s first Little House novel has sold tens of millions of copies and has been translated into over thirty languages.

According to the passage, which of the following events led Wilder to decide to write about her childhood?

A.	Her first manuscript was rejected.
B.	Her daughter supported the idea.

Luis was on his way to China to help document an archeological study on the army of life-size terracotta clay soldiers guarding the tomb of Qin Shi Huangdi, China’s first self-proclaimed emperor. As he read through the report, Luis began to learn more about the history of the tomb. He read that Qin Shi Huangdi started constructing the mausoleum soon after ascending the throne at the age of thirteen. Luis was surprised to discover that more than 700,000 people worked on the tomb before construction stopped in 209 BC. He had not realized that excavations within the tomb revealed models of various buildings, including palaces and offices, in addition to the soldiers.

Style is a quality; the “historic styles” are phases of development. Style is character expressive of definite conceptions, as of grandeur, gaiety, or solemnity. An historic style is the particular phase, the characteristic manner of design, which prevails at a given time and place. It is not the result of mere accident or caprice, but of intellectual, moral, social, religious, and even political conditions. Gothic architecture could never have been invented by the Greeks, nor could the Egyptian styles have grown up in Italy. Each style is based upon some fundamental principle springing from its surrounding civilization, which undergoes successive developments until it either reaches perfection or its possibilities are exhausted, after which a period of decline usually sets in.

The passage suggests that historic styles of architecture

A.	are a reflection of the civilizations that develop them.

The “gray matter” of the brain and cord is made up of nerve cells and their dendrites, and the terminations of axons, which enter from the adjoining white matter. A part of the mass of gray matter also consists of the neuroglia which surrounds the nerve cells and fibers, and a network of blood vessels. The “white matter” of the central system consists chiefly of axons with their enveloping or medullary, sheath and neuroglia. The white matter contains no nerve cells or dendrites. The difference in color of the gray and the white matter is caused chiefly by the fact that in the gray masses the medullary sheath, which is white, is lacking, thus revealing the ashen gray of the nerve threads. In the white masses the medullary sheath is present.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

Isograms, which are also referred to as nonpattern words, are words in which the individual letters occur an equal number of times. First-order isograms, like uncopyrightable and dermatoglyphics, are words with letters that occur only once. The more challenging second- and third-order isograms contain individual letters that occur twice and three times, respectively. The word “deed,” for example, is a second-order isogram because its letters “d” and “e” each occur twice. The past-tense verb form of this word, “deeded,” is a third-order isogram, because each of the two letters occurs three times. Longer second- and third-order isograms are typically obscure words like the fourteen-letter “scintillescent” and the nine-letter “sheeshehs.”

However, the northern pillar is located on the continent of Europe on a small peninsula off the Iberian coast and is known as the Rock of Gibraltar. The waterway between the pillars is known as the Strait of Gibraltar, which marked the edge of civilization to the ancient Greeks. According to Greek mythology, Heracles (Hercules) split a great mountain in two with his sword to reach Geryon, a three-headed giant.

In addition to the well-known “Windy City” and “Chi-Town,” Chicago has been referred to by many other names including “City by the Lake,” “Chicagoland,” “Hog Butcher of the World,” and “City of Broad Shoulders.” One of the city’s most recognized nicknames, “Second City” has a disputed origin. One popular theory has it that the nickname is actually an unfavorable comparison of rank to New York City, which has always been larger in population. For this reason, some Chicagoans consider the nickname demeaning. Another, more plausible theory is that the nickname came about after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The fire destroyed the “first” Chicago, whose buildings consisted largely of wood, giving residents the opportunity to build a better and more enduring city. Moreover, the often misunderstood “Windy City” does not refer to the city’s strong breezes, but rather to its boastfulness, a label that has become a source of pride.

Maglev is an abbreviated term for magnetic levitation, which aptly describes how the trains function: they literally levitate via magnetic repulsion. Floating nearly four inches above special guideways, maglev trains are faster than traditional trains mainly because they eliminate the friction that occurs between the wheels and the tracks. By comparison, the fastest train in the United States that same year peaked at 150 miles per hour, though it averaged a mere 75 miles per hour. Because of the efficiency and speed of maglev trains, more countries are starting to use them. Shanghai’s airport line maglev train, for example, which opened in December of 2003, boasts a flawless on-time arrival record for its millions of passengers, serving as a testament to the maglev’s impressive reliability and performance.

Tachylite is a highly basic volcanic glass, standing in the same relation to basalt and andesite that obsidian does to trachyte and rhyolite. It is much heavier than obsidian, and is perfectly black and opaque, except in the finest fibers. It is a comparatively rare rock, for the reason that basalt and andesite crystallize more readily than the acidic rocks on passing from the liquid to the solid state. On the surface of the basic lava, however, where it is in contact with the air, and congeals almost instantly, a film of glass is formed; but this may not be more than a small fraction of an inch in thickness. Like obsidian, tachylite is often vesicular; but the vesicular basic rocks, as well as the solid, are usually stony.

As a contemporary of Byron, Leopardi is perhaps credited with a certain amount of psychological plagiarism, and possibly disregarded as a mere satellite of the greater planet. But if this be so, it is unjust. His fame is his own, and time makes his isolation and grand individuality more and more prominent. What Byron and Shelley, Millevoye, Baudelaire and Gautier, Heine and Platen, Pushkin and Lermontov, are to England, France, Germany, and Russia respectively, Leopardi is, in a measure, to Italy. But he is more than this. The jewel of his renown is triple-faceted. Philology, poetry, and philosophy were each in turn cultivated by him, and he was of too brilliant an intellect not to excel in them all.

One theory suggests that humans adopted orphaned wolf pups and bred them to become more docile creatures. Domestication occurred when humans favored wolves that showed less fear toward people. In turn, their offspring similarly had less fear of humans. Over time, wolves evolved into the dogs we know today. While the domesticated dog did not change much for thousands of years, civilization changed, and the need for different types of dogs did as well. By a similar process of selective breeding, different breeds of dogs have emerged, and many of them have been bred for a specific purpose such as for hunting, retrieving, pulling sleds, companionship, or providing care for people in need. Today there are more than 400 different dog breeds worldwide.

Of the wide variety of gemstones, there are only four generally recognized as precious: rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds. Other gemstones, such as pearls, jaspers, and garnets, are typically classified as semiprecious. While some people believe the classification between precious and semiprecious is ancient, it dates back only to the nineteenth century. In fact, the term “semiprecious” was first used in 1858 to suggest a lesser commercial value than precious gems. Furthermore, while the distinction between precious and semiprecious continues, many believe it to be arbitrary and derogatory. Semiprecious stones are generally less desired on the open market, even if they are more beautiful and more rare. Although the distinction is still observed today, gemstones—precious or otherwise—are appreciated for their beauty by people worldwide.

During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, individual mining, textile, and lumber companies across the United States built and operated what were known as “company towns” to accommodate workers and their families. One of the longest surviving company towns was Scotia in Humboldt County, California. In the 1880s, a lumber company built Scotia’s first buildings to provide housing for its lumberjacks. As the company grew, so did the town’s amenities. In less than 50 years, the town boasted a saloon, hotel, additional operating sawmills, a fire department, a bank, a theater, an elementary school, and a hospital, all of which were owned by the lumber company. During the mid-1980s, the lumber business was sold, and in 2007, the town’s new owners went bankrupt. In 2011, the Scotia community was given the option of being put up for sale again or becoming a self-governing entity.

The “Writer,” a 700-millimeter-tall automaton, or robot, built in the 1700s, was his most complicated creation, composed of approximately 6,000 parts. It featured a wooden figure of a boy seated at a desk with a quill pen in hand, and over 4,000 parts controlled the quill alone. The quill’s main components included three groups of 40 cams—machine parts that move by rotating to create a certain motion—that together formed an elongated vertical cylinder. Each set of cams controlled a specific action—such as vertical movements, horizontal movements, and the amount of pressure the automaton applied to a sheet of paper. When the Writer was in operation, it dipped a quill into an inkpot while moving its head and eyes as if it was following along with the words it was writing.

The town, which included employee housing and industrial buildings, was built to accommodate the company’s growing railroad car construction business. The employee housing in this planned community was praised for its modern conveniences and aesthetically pleasing design. Yet, despite these aspects, the residents soon became dissatisfied with Pullman’s many rules. Residents were not allowed to hold town meetings, and they had to pay rent for their homes without the possibility of purchase. They also faced random inspections and could be evicted at a moment’s notice. The discontent peaked when orders for luxury railroad cars declined and the company lowered worker’s wages without lowering their rent. This led to a violent worker’s strike that ended only after federal intervention. In 1898, the state’s supreme court ruled that the company sell its non-industrial holdings. By 1907, all the houses had been sold, and the city of Chicago assumed responsibility for the streets and parks.

According to the passage, the workers’ strike was a final reaction to

A.	a ban on holding community meetings.
B.	the prohibition against home purchases.

Motivated by the aim to sue one of his legal guardians for leaving him a scanty inheritance, Demosthenes adopted a rigorous practice regimen to become a persuasive and captivating rhetorician. He was extreme and experimental in his practice, building an underground study in which to train his voice and speaking with pebbles in his mouth to overcome a lisp and a stammer. Demosthenes also practiced delivering his speeches in front of a mirror and shouting over the sound of crashing waves on a beach. Although Demosthenes’s first public speech generated laughter among the audience, his remarkable rhetorical skill did not go unnoticed. In time, he achieved success writing speeches on behalf of powerful, affluent clients.

According to the passage, Demosthenes sought to become an orator because he wanted to

Begin by gathering a bowl, cup, plate, sponge, sieve, and water conditioner. Using the cup, remove about half the water from the betta’s tank and pour it in the bowl. Next, gently transfer the betta from the tank to the bowl. Because bettas can jump, cover the bowl with the plate, leaving a small gap for air. Next, drain the remaining water from the tank down the sink. If the tank was lined with gravel, drain the water through a sieve to catch the gravel, and then rinse the gravel thoroughly with warm water to remove any waste particles. Scrub the surfaces of the tank with the sponge, and then place the cleaned gravel in the tank. Remembering to leave enough room for the old water, partially fill the tank with tap water, and then add some water conditioner to dechlorinate the water. Finally, let the new tank water reach room temperature before returning the old water and the betta to the tank.

Based on the passage, what should be done just before adding tap water to the tank?

A.	Scrub the surfaces of the tank.
B.	Return the old water to the tank.
C.	Place the cleaned gravel in the tank.

After that, Ruben thought about the dairy products he needed and added milk, yogurt, and whipping cream to the list. Then he jotted down sliced turkey and ham, because the deli counter was just around the corner.

Begin at the beginning, and do not allow yourself to gratify a mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book, here and there. This would very likely lead to your throwing it aside, with the remark “This is much too hard for me!”, and thus losing the chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights. This Rule (of not dipping) is very desirable with other kinds of books—such as novels, for instance, where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story, by dipping into it further on, so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of course.

Which of the following best restates the author's main point?

B.	Reading books involves following several rules.
C.	Reading for entertainment requires minimal effort.

The title, “A Library of the World’s Best Literature,” is strictly descriptive. It means that what is offered to the reader is taken from the best authors, and is fairly representative of the best literature and of all literatures. It may be important historically, or because at one time it expressed the thought and feeling of a nation, or because it has the character of universality, or because the readers of today will find it instructive, entertaining, or amusing. The Work aims to suit a great variety of tastes, and thus to commend itself as a household companion for any mood and any hour. There is no intention of presenting merely a mass of historical material, however important it is in its place, which is commonly of the sort that people recommend others to read and do not read themselves. It is not a library of reference only, but a library to be read.

Which of the following statements about the author’s collection best summarizes the passage?

C.	It represents a variety of different philosophies.

His passion for music was scarcely less than his interest in speculation and history. He knew well the great composers, and had himself composed. Though the master of no instrument, he could touch the piano with feeling. He had a pleasant baritone voice, and nothing gave him more refreshment after a week of study or lecturing than to pour himself out in song.

In fact, one cup of sliced mango provides about 100 percent of the recommended daily level of vitamin C. In addition, mangoes are high in vitamin A and fiber. Mangoes are a fruit, and they are relatives of both pistachio and cashew nuts. Thought to have originated in India over 5,000 years ago, mangoes and their seeds migrated with humans who traveled across the world to places such as the Middle East, East Africa, and South America. Worldwide production of mangoes has been increasing; however, India remains the country that produces the greatest percentage of the world’s mangoes.

Fortunately, this time she was near a bus stop and could load her bike on the next bus and then ride the bus home instead of changing her tire on the side of a busy street. When she began working at an office located less than three miles from her apartment, she thought commuting to work by bike would be a fantastic way to exercise, save money, and practice responsible environmental stewardship. Biking to work, she knew, was beneficial, but with the number of mechanical and logistical hassles she had experienced with her bike, she could have walked to work and reaped many of the same benefits.

Although the temperature was near freezing, they found it was easy to ignore the cold because their layered outdoor skating outfits insulated them against the elements. With gloved hands tightly clasped, Francine and Walt skated together through the whirling snow in unsteady circles before they gained enough confidence to let go of each other and strike out on their own.

After they mastered those moves, she’d teach them the jazz walk. Then, she’d demonstrate how to drop to a semi-crouch position and rest both hands on the left hip, and the team would work on learning that move.

Being somewhat prepared, I was not altogether surprised to find that this first view of a tropical island forcibly reminded me of the last land I had beheld at home—the northern shores of the Isle of Wight. Long swelling hills, on which well-grown trees intervene between tracts of tillage, present much the same general outline, and at this distance the only marked difference was the intense dark-green color of the large trees that embower the town and nearly conceal all but a few of the chief buildings.

This caused a sort of artificial night during the middle of the day, but the Primrose ladies were used to it, and went about the darkened house like cats or bats or owls or moles, or any other creatures who can see in the dark.

Although he is only eight inches long and weighs about one and a half ounces, he still attracts quite a bit of attention with his beautiful coloration. Ringo’s black and white wings have a span of twelve inches, and his body is a captivating shade of sky blue. My budgie’s olive-yellow beak is strong and smooth and is almost hidden by his fluffy head feathers. Budgies tend to be extremely active birds, and Ringo is no exception. He enjoys singing, napping, eating, and interacting with me and my other budgies. What’s more, Ringo has an easy-going temperament, and has already proven to be a quick learner. In a few months, I hope to take him to the county bird show so that everyone can see what a splendid bird he is.

The author describes Ringo largely in terms of his

Though she never ran professionally, she was and still is a member of the local running club, and she consistently places among the top three finishers in her age group. She says the key to being a good runner is relaxation, focus, good form, and most importantly, a positive attitude. At age 62, Angie exhibits a joy of running that inspires runners of all shapes, sizes, and experience levels.

Bender had a friend, a man of his own ilk, with whom he had hit camp and log-drive for these last ten years. At birth it is supposable that the friend inherited a name, but in the camps he was known only as the “Cougar.” A silent man, broad, deep-lunged, fierce-eyed, nature had laid his lines for great height, then bent him in a perpetual crouch. He always seemed gathering for a spring, which, combined with tigerish courage, had gained him his name. Inseparable, if Bender appeared on the Mattawa for the spring drive, it was known that the Cougar might be shortly expected. If the Cougar stole into a Rocky Mountain camp, a bunk was immediately reserved for his big affinity.

Hardly have I done so when in come the squirrels, sliding up to the window and leaping on to the table to enjoy the nuts. They will take nuts gently from our hands, and sitting up in the graceful position a squirrel adopts when quite at ease—its tail curved over its back, and its tiny paws holding the nut—they crack them and fling away the shells in careless fashion.

She started working on her family’s dairy farm at a young age, and she eventually assumed full ownership of the business. During the 1950s, Pauline expanded the dairy herd from 100 jersey cows to an impressive 300, and she became one of the leading milk producers in the state at that time. Cindy, Pauline’s daughter, considered it a privilege to learn the particulars of the dairy industry from her mother, and when Pauline retired, Cindy assumed management of the farm. With the purchase of 800 acres of nearby alfalfa and grain fields, Cindy has increased the herd to about 1,500 animals.

Century eggs, popular in China, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Singapore, are typically prepared by immersing duck eggs in a mixture of lime, black tea, salt, and wood ash and letting them cure anywhere from several weeks to several months. The century egg, also called the hundred-year egg, millennium egg, and thousand-year egg, originated in the Hunan Province of China. Legend has it that over 500 years ago a farmer accidently unearthed a clutch of duck eggs naturally preserved in a layer of clay and slaked lime, or calcium hydroxide. Curious about his new discovery, the farmer tasted the eggs and enjoyed them enough to recreate nature’s recipe. The eggs are an acquired taste for some due to their potent odor and green hue. However, many people appreciate them for their smooth texture and rich, savory flavor and recommend that first-timers incorporate them into a dish such as soup or stir-fried vegetables rather than eating them solo.

However, Caravaggio was also famous, or rather infamous, for his feud with Giovanni Baglione, one of his rivals. Baglione, jealous of the attention that Caravaggio’s Amor Vincit Omnia received from Roman nobility, painted a parody of the work and included an insulting caricature of Caravaggio. In retaliation, Caravaggio and his friends wrote offensive poems about Baglione, and Caravaggio was subsequently incarcerated for defaming him. Caravaggio was eventually released from prison with the help of his prominent friends, but his reputation remained tarnished for the rest of his life. Even after Caravaggio’s death, Baglione’s ill feelings toward his rival prompted him to write a disparaging biography about Caravaggio’s life.

Although the two scientists started out as friends, their relationship quickly soured when Marsh, unbeknownst to Cope, established a relationship with the owner of a fossil quarry that Cope had trustingly shown him. Marsh paid the quarry owner to send him, and not Cope, any new fossils that were unearthed. Another incident indicative of the men’s antagonistic relationship occurred when Marsh pointed out an embarrassing mistake Cope made assembling a prominent dinosaur skeleton. For his part, Cope spent years gathering information on Marsh’s unethical professional behavior and submitted the documentation to a journalist, who published the accusations. As a result, Marsh was fired from his post and forced to relinquish a large part of his personal fossil collection. Despite a failed friendship and damage to both of their reputations, their fierce competition helped fuel the discovery of over 100 dinosaur species.

Damaged U.S. currency can be exchanged at any bank; however, bills considered mutilated require a claim to be submitted to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). The first step in determining whether and how to replace paper currency is to ask a few questions. Can you read the value of your banknote easily, or are the indications of value illegible without special examination? Is more than half the original size of the banknote remaining? If you can read the value and most of the banknote hasn’t been destroyed, the money is not a loss but is considered damaged. You may simply exchange it at a bank, or you may even be able to use it as is. If you can’t read the value easily and have less than half the banknote—for instance, the money was burned in a fire or by chemicals—you will have to submit a claim to the BEP. To do this, ship a package to the BEP containing the money fragment along with a letter explaining how the bill became mutilated and estimating its value.

Based on the passage, a banknote less than half its original size and of unknown value should be 

A.	considered damaged.
B.	submitted to the BEP.

To draw a basic linear perspective coastal scene on a rectangular piece of paper, first turn the paper sideways so the long edge is on the bottom. Decide where you want the horizon between sea and sky, and then divide the paper by drawing a horizontal line from one side of the paper to the other. The next step involves establishing the vanishing point, which is a point in the distance where parallel lines appear to converge. Set a vanishing point midway along the horizontal line, and then sketch the objects you want to draw in perspective such as boats or a wharf or loading dock. Make sure the objects are drawn so lines seem to converge at the vanishing point in the “back” and diverge in the “front.” For example, looking down the length of a dock, both sides should extend toward the vanishing point.

Based on the passage, what should be done just before sketching the objects?

A.	Turn the paper sideways.
B.	Establish the vanishing point.
C.	Decide where to place the horizon.

This book is intended for the use of persons who are supposed to be altogether ignorant of the art of sailing. It is a primer and, therefore, is almost absurdly simple and profuse in explanatory details. But my experience as a teacher has taught me that such books cannot be too simple, and that in order to be understandable they must be loaded with explanations of explanations until nothing is left to explain. To those who know, this will seem unnecessary, but it must be remembered that many who will learn from this book, have not only never handled a sailing boat, but have never seen one before, and have but extremely crude notions of how the canvas and helm are employed to drive and direct them.

I am impatient when people insist on talking to me about it; I am glad if they like it, but do not much care if they don’t. I am no more interested in it than in a worn-out suit of clothes that I have given away. It was thus with disinclination that I began to read The Magician. It held my interest, as two of my early novels, which for the same reason I have been obliged to read, did not. One, indeed, I simply could not get through.

Because of this, looking at the etymology—that is, the history of a word—will sometimes lead to interesting stories about the past. For example, take the word sycophant, a disparaging term used to describe a person who praises powerful people for personal gain. The term comes from the Greek word sykophantes, which roughly translates to “one who shows figs.” How might the word sycophant have developed its English meaning? One theory relies on the fact that in Athens, Greece, during the sixth century, exporting any food other than olives was against the law. Smugglers who attempted to transport figs across the border were sometimes threatened by ordinary citizens—not to prevent the smugglers from breaking the law, but to blackmail them. If the smugglers refused to the pay, the blackmailers, derisively called sykophantes, would contact the authorities.

Based on the passage, the sykophantes confronted the smugglers in order to

Telegraph operators developed call letters to make it easier to send messages. Rather than spelling the entire name of the transmitter, operators could simply use a three-letter call sign. This practice was further refined in 1912 at the London International Radiotelegraphic Conference, where specific letters for call signs were assigned to different countries. The U.S. was given some combinations of letters beginning with K and all combinations beginning with N or W. Initially, radio call signs were limited to three-letters, but when those combinations ran out in 1922, four letters began to be used for new stations. Around 1923, the standards for new call signs in the U.S. established the Mississippi River as the boundary line. Stations east of the river would start with W and those west of the river would start with K. Up to 1927, radio call signs were selected by the Department of Commerce, which licensed radio stations.

In fact, a doctor who mandated handwashing by medical students and junior physicians to reduce patient mortality did so years before germ theory became universally accepted, and he was subsequently ridiculed by his colleagues and largely forgotten by history. The doctor was Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician who practiced at Vienna General Hospital. Semmelweis suspected cross-contamination by doctors’ hands was the source of a toxin causing patients’ deaths. So, in 1847, he implemented the policy of handwashing by doctors with a chlorinated lime solution before treating patients. Despite the hospital’s dramatic reduction in patient deaths from infection, Semmelweis did not publish his findings for over a decade. He lost his clinical appointment at the Vienna General Hospital several years after his controversial discovery, eventually leaving Vienna and returning to his homeland of Budapest.

One example is number, which can refer to a numeral or the state of being more numb. Heteronyms, along with other English irregularities, have prompted people throughout history to call for English spelling to be reformed so it is more phonetic. Thus, number (the “more numb” version) would be spelled nummer, without the unpronounced letter b. English has many spelling idiosyncrasies because it borrows words from several languages that have different approaches to spelling. The particular spelling of any given word thus provides clues to its semantic heritage—much of which would be lost if all English words were spelled phonetically.

3016.	When it comes to grammar, there are two main schools of thought. People either support the use of prescriptive grammar or they are like me and embrace descriptive grammar. Prescriptive grammar focuses on the proper way to use a language, on how people should speak and write. On the other hand, descriptive grammar recognizes languages are fluid and the “correct” way to use a language is dictated by its native speakers—all of them. Take the word irregardless, for example. Prescriptive grammarians would say that irregardless is not an actual word but rather an improper variant of regardless. However, its part of speech is easily identified, it has a consistent spelling, and its meaning, for most people, is quite clear. More importantly, irregardless is frequently used by many native speakers of the English language. So clearly it’s a word. Prescriptive grammarians object to irregardless because it uses both the prefix ir– and the suffix –less, a double negative, which is strongly discouraged in the English language because it can be confusing. Yet, languages are shaped by their speakers, and grammar should allow for creativity.

Based on the passage, the view of the author is that prescriptive grammar is 

A.	confining.
B.	incorrect.
C.	careless.

It will be essential throughout this chapter, and indeed throughout the whole work, to bear in mind that it was not till quite modern times that a separate class was formed to buy copyrights, to employ printers, and to sell the books wholesale, to which their names were affixed on the title-pages—to be in fact, in the modern acceptation of the word, Publishers. There was no such class among the old booksellers; but they had to do everything for themselves, to construct the types, presses, and other essentials for printing, to bind the sheets when printed, and finally, when the books were manufactured, to sell them to the general public. For long, many of the booksellers had printing offices; they all, of course, kept shops, at which not only printed books but stationery was retailed; bookbinders were not infrequent among them; and, to very recent times, they were the chief proprietors of newspapers, a branch of the trade that appears, from some modern instances, to be again falling in their direction.

Everything seemed to show that Alexander [the Great] had very early acted under the idea of being a king, and of pursuing, in that character, a career of conquest. No doubt all around him, the courtiers, his father and mother, and his teachers had thus trained him, and no doubt all this coincided with his natural turn of mind. He not only showed personal courage, but a precocious desire of practical knowledge. When less than twelve years of age, ambassadors came to visit the court of Macedon from Persia. [King] Philip was absent, and Alexander therefore received them with great politeness, and a sobriety quite astonishing. He asked no trifling or childish questions; but made a great many inquiries about the roads to Persia; the distance from place to place; the situation of certain provinces; the character of their king; how he treated his enemies; in what the power of Persia lay, etc.

Based on the passage, the author’s attitude toward Alexander is

A.	admiring.

He planned to invite several friends over for dinner, and he needed a larger table and more chairs to seat everyone. After giving away his small three-piece dining set, he checked a thrift store in town in hopes of finding a gently used set within his budget. Theo disliked most of the furniture styles available at the thrift store, and the one set he did like was a little too large for his space and the color clashed with his dining room. He visited a furniture store next, and although he liked their selection, he didn’t want to pay their high prices. Then he heard about an estate sale in his neighborhood. There, he finally found exactly what he wanted—a beautiful dining room table large enough to accommodate six people and plenty of food. When Theo hosted his party, his friends not only raved about his new home, but praised his taste in furniture as well.

Hiratsuka graduated from a prominent Japanese women’s university in 1906, and, five years later published a literary magazine titled Seito. This publication, aimed to showcase women’s talents, borrowed its name from the English term “bluestocking,” a pejorative nickname for intellectual women who were interested in literature and new ideas. Then in 1920, Hiratsuka advocated for maternity benefits and also co-founded the New Woman’s Association, which sought to enlist men to help improve the social and legal positions of Japanese women. Two years later, mainly as a result of this group’s endeavors, the Public Order and Police Law was amended, expanding women’s rights to participate in politics. Hiratsuka was also a pioneer in the women’s suffrage movement, and through her efforts, along with those of other social and political activists, Japanese women achieved the right to vote in 1945.

Born in Italy in 1364, de Pizan relocated to France when her father became the astrologer to King Charles V. Although it was unusual for women of the time to receive an education, her father ensured his daughter did. At the age of 25, de Pizan became a widow and the sole supporter of her family. To earn a living, she wrote poetry and prose for members of the French court. Her works were well received, and soon she was writing for the most prominent members of the royal family, including the queen. In an era when women were wholly reliant upon others for support, de Pizan not only gained financial independence through her writing, but she was able to use her works to contradict the negative depictions of women often found in literature. At the age of 51, she retired to a convent and continued her studies and writings, including a poem about the French heroine, Joan of Arc.

Galen was a man of wide culture, and one of his essays is written for the purpose of urging physicians to become acquainted with other branches of knowledge besides medicine.

In philosophy, as in medicine, he had studied the teachings of the various schools of thought, and did not bind himself to any sect in particular. He disagreed with the Sceptics in their belief that no such thing as certainty was attainable, and it was his custom in cases of extreme difficulty to suspend his judgment; for instance, in reference to the nature of the soul, he wrote that he had not been able to come to a definite opinion.

I adopted Buttons just over a year ago from an animal shelter, after I accompanied a friend there who was looking for a pet kitten. After I signed the adoption papers and took Buttons home, I learned she is actually pretty intelligent and fairly lively and sociable. Since hamsters are nocturnal, she sleeps during the day while I’m at work, and she’s up and ready to play when I get home in the evening. Unlike my dog Stella, Buttons takes up a relatively small amount of space and makes little to no noise. If you have never owned a pet hamster, especially one as lovable as Buttons, I would highly recommend considering this kind of pet the next time you are looking to adopt an animal.

First, it is a good idea to arrive at the airport two to three hours before your flight to give yourself enough time to check in, go through security, and find your departure gate. Also, to avoid extra security checks or fees at the gate, verify before leaving home that your carry-on luggage adheres to all safety and security standards. Finally, if connecting at multiple airports, be sure you schedule each layover to allow enough time to get to the next gate; this is especially true for international flights, when additional customs and immigration processes can be lengthy. My family and I traveled to Mexico in March, and upon reentering the United States, we needed over an hour to get through customs. This caused us to miss our connecting flight. However, by following these few guidelines, you should be able to avoid unnecessary travel woes and enjoy a trouble-free flight to your business or vacation destination.

Although he was fairly content with his current living situation, he knew he would make good use of a full-size kitchen and would enjoy having a spare bedroom for his sister when she came to the city. Dante could certainly afford a two-bedroom apartment with his recent promotion, but the hassle of moving seemed daunting. Packing up all of his belongings and moving his furniture from his sixth-floor studio apartment into a truck was exhausting just to think about. However, Dante knew he could rely on his best friend to help him. Moreover, the lease on his studio apartment was almost up, so it would be the perfect time to look for and transition to a larger space. He eyed the phone sitting on his desk and suddenly reached for it. If he called right now, he could be checking out apartments by this weekend.

Based on the passage, it is likely Dante will make a phone call to his

A.	sister.
B.	friend.
C.	realtor.
D.	landlord.

Tea is a work of art and needs a master hand to bring out its noblest qualities. We have good and bad tea, as we have good and bad paintings—generally the latter. There is no single recipe for making the perfect tea, as there are no rules for producing a Titian or a Sesson. Each preparation of the leaves has its individuality, its special affinity with water and heat, its own method of telling a story. The truly beautiful must always be in it. How much do we not suffer through the constant failure of society to recognize this simple and fundamental law of art and life; Lichilai, a Sung poet, has sadly remarked that there were three most deplorable things in the world: the spoiling of fine youths through false education, the degradation of fine art through vulgar admiration, and the utter waste of fine tea through incompetent manipulation.

Based on the passage, the author’s attitude toward tea is

A.	ironic.
B.	reverent.
C.	nostalgic.
D.	objective.

However, one hundred pages into this first book review, his supervisor and senior editor wanted to know if Hector was finished with the assignment. Hector realized then that he would need to pick up the pace and wrap up editing of the remaining pages much faster. Then, when he was only about halfway through the first book review, Hector’s supervisor informed him of two more manuscripts he needed to edit, each approximately 250-pages long, before the end of the month. Hector grimaced and sighed as he added the two projects to his already packed schedule.

Barbarian—derived from the ancient Greek word barbaros—once meant babbler. The term imitated the sounds Greek speakers heard foreign speakers make, sounds the Greeks couldn’t understand. However, the Romans eventually changed the meaning of the word when they began referring to all foreigners—especially those intruding upon their territory—as barbarians. Over time, scholars began using the term to describe enemies who attacked another civilization and did not share that civilization’s language or customs. Today, barbarian is used to describe a crude, uncivilized individual. What started out as a term referring to incomprehensible speech has morphed into a word with a very different meaning.

According to the passage, the term barbarian initially meant

A.	brutal.
B.	bandit.
C.	babbler.
D.	backcountry.

Van Buren was a unique president in several ways. Most notably, he was the first president to be born an American citizen, unlike his presidential predecessors who were all born as British subjects before 1776—the year the Continental Congress declared America’s independence from Britain. Born to Dutch parents, Van Buren grew up in Kinderhook, New York, and learned to speak English as a second language, which was another presidential first. Though not the first vice president to ascend to the presidency, Van Buren is one of only four who did so in almost 200 years, excluding those who became president after the death of a sitting president.

Based on the passage, Van Buren was the first U.S. president to

Mildred “Babe” Didrikson Zaharias was an extremely gifted athlete who was once voted the “Woman Athlete of the Half Century.” In high school, the multi-talented athlete was a star performer on her school’s basketball, baseball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and swimming teams. Even as a teenager, Didrikson (her married name was Zaharias) aspired to become the greatest athlete of all time. In the 1932 Amateur Athletic Union national championships, she dominated the women’s meet and won the team title even though she was the only person on her team. Astoundingly, the team that came in second had a team of 22 women. Later that year, when Didrikson competed in the Olympics, she won two gold medals and one silver medal and set two new world records. Just a few years later, she became the first female to compete in a Professional Golfer’s Association event and went on to win 82 women’s golf tournaments over the course of her career. Later, in 1949, she co-founded the Ladies Professional Golf Association and served as its president for many years.

It was almost 8:00 a.m., and he had to report for his shift at the market promptly at 9:15 a.m. He quickly got out of bed and went to start the shower. When no water came out of the showerhead, he remembered his building manager had mentioned the water would be shut off that morning due to property maintenance. Walking out of the bathroom, Gary grabbed a clean work uniform from his closet, got dressed, and packed his lunch—a ham sandwich on wheat—and was out the door in 15 minutes. Almost to his car, he heard his dog Coco bark from the back yard and remembered Coco needed her morning walk. So he went back inside, hooked Coco’s leash to her collar, and took the dog for a short walk. Finally ready to go, Gary started up his car and drove the 20 minutes to the market, realizing only when he arrived that he had forgotten his lunch at home.

There is one precept, however, in which I shall only be opposed by the vain, the ignorant, and the idle. I am not afraid that I shall repeat it too often. You must have no dependence on your own genius. If you have great talents, industry will improve them; if you have but moderate abilities, industry will supply their deficiency. Nothing is denied to well-directed labor: nothing is to be obtained without it. Not to enter into metaphysical discussions on the nature or essence of genius, I will venture to assert, that assiduity unabated by difficulty, and a disposition eagerly directed to the object of its pursuit, will produce effects similar to those which some call the result of natural powers.

I went in search of Talbot; partly because I knew he was on the verge of a collapse, partly, as I frankly admitted to myself, because I was sorry the young man had come to grief. I searched the snow-swept decks, and then, after threading my way through faintly lit tunnels, I knocked at his cabin. The sound of his voice gave me a distinct feeling of relief. But he would not admit me. Through the closed door he declared he was “all right,” wanted no medical advice, and asked only to resume the sleep he claimed I had broken. I left him, not without uneasiness, and the next morning the sight of him still in the flesh was a genuine thrill. I found him walking the deck carrying himself nonchalantly and trying to appear unconscious of the glances—amused, contemptuous, hostile—that were turned toward him. He would have passed me without speaking, but I took his arm and led him to the rail.

How shall I convey the faintest conception of its splendor to a reader who has seen nothing similar? It was not like what I may call the normal arctic glacier, which spreads out at its foot into a very wide, low dome ending all round in an even curve. This glacier is formed by the union of many ice streams, whose combined volume is wedged together at last between rock walls, and thus broken up by compression. The sea front, therefore, is not a mere cliff, but is the section of a maze of crevasses, and even seracs [ice pillars]. There were overhanging towers and enormous caverns, jutting masses and deep holes, all toned in every variety of white and blue and green, shadowed in purple by passing clouds or shining in silver splendor beneath the direct rays of the clear sunlight.

Many people feared the world’s computers would malfunction at midnight when the date changed from December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000. Because many computer programs and computer chips stored year values as two digits only, the abbreviation “00” might be interpreted as “1900” instead of 2000. It was feared that a misinterpreted “00” date would cause computer systems to crash, wreaking havoc on the banking industry, utility grids, and other entities that relied on computer technology. The scare prompted massive efforts to update hardware and software. In the U.S., insurance companies sold Y2K specialty policies, and legislation was passed to stimulate sharing of information across companies about how to handle Y2K. The British government prepared its armed forces to provide assistance in the event of chaos, and the United Nations convened international conferences on Y2K.

While the book has been studied in Asia for a long time, it did not become known in the West until the late eighteenth century and was not accurately translated until two centuries after that. Rather than emphasizing the use of brute force to achieve material and physical harm—a tactic that was integral to the Western style of warfare—Sun Tzu’s strategy emphasized psychological warfare, aiming to disrupt an enemy’s morale and ability to resist effectively. This meant using deception and other unconventional means to break alliances, evade battles, and organize surprise attacks. The height of military skill, according to Sun Tzu, is not to attack the enemy, but rather to attack the enemy’s strategy, which could potentially result in a fightless victory. For military institutions in both the East and West, Sun Tzu’s ancient Chinese military treatise is required reading.

According to the passage, traditional western-style warfare focused on

Ferris created the unique attraction to serve as the centerpiece of the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago. The highlight of the previous world’s fair, held in Paris, was none other than the famous Eiffel Tower. The Chicago fair organizers were thus under great pressure to somehow eclipse the great tower. After several brainstorming sessions yielded no novel ideas—the most serious suggestion was a taller tower—Ferris conceived of the wheel. The original Ferris wheel was first unveiled on June 21, 1893, and became a huge success. During the fair, more than 1.4 million people bought tickets to ride the wheel to the top and appreciate the spectacular aerial view of the city. Whether Ferris succeeded in topping the Eiffel Tower is a matter of debate, as both the Ferris wheel and the Eiffel Tower are magnificent monuments to human ingenuity.

One morning, after an untroubled night’s sleep, I awoke soon after sunrise, and from my place in bed, nearest the window, looked lazily out upon the day. Still half-asleep, I lay for some time without noting anything unusual; but as my sensibilities revived I observed that the screen was missing from the left-hand window, and that the dressing table, instead of standing in its usual place against the wall, was turned half-way around, and projected at right angles into the room. I was out of bed in an instant, and at the window—looking out of which I saw the screen lying flat on the floor of the veranda. I went out and examined it. It was uninjured, and the bolts still projected from either side to show that they had not been drawn; but two deep grooves in the woodwork of the casing indicated that the screen had been dragged outward from its place.

The first newspaper ever published in America appeared in Boston in 1690, and was named Public Occurrences. For the crime of uttering “reflections of a very high nature,” it was immediately extinguished by the authorities of Massachusetts,—not even attaining the dignity of a second number. Under this rough blow, the real birth of American journalism hesitated for fourteen years. On April 4, 1704, was published in Boston the first number of an American newspaper that lived. It was called The Boston News-Letter. For fifteen years, it continued to be the only newspaper in America. At last, on December 21, 1719, a rival newspaper was started, named The Boston Gazette; and on the twenty-second day of the same month, in the same year, there appeared in Philadelphia the first newspaper published in this country outside of Boston. This was called The American Weekly Mercury. From that time onward, the fashion of having newspapers spread rapidly.

The ancient supercontinent Pangea began to form when the continent Laurentia, which included parts of present-day North America, formed Euramerica by merging with several smaller continents. Euramerica then collided with another supercontinent called Gondwana. Then, Pangaea began to break apart when Laurasia (North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana separated. Gondwana then broke apart to form separate continents, many of which we know today, including South America. Laurasia next broke into two continents, with North America splitting from Eurasia. A few million years later, Greenland broke apart from what is now Europe, and lastly, Australia separated from Antarctica. Though moving 500 million times slower than bumper cars at an amusement park, the tectonic plates are parts of an integrated system that underwent dramatic change over hundreds of millions of years.

However, when studied more closely, ladybugs have several traits that might tarnish their innocent reputations. First, many ladybugs are carnivores and some species even exhibit cannibalistic tendencies toward the larva of others. Moreover, some ladybugs are also poisonous creatures. Their poison is not deadly to humans, but research shows the redder a ladybug’s shell, the more toxic the insect is for predators to consume. Lastly, ladybugs emit a horrible odor if they sense a threat, which can affect the taste of crops when ladybugs infest farms and vineyards. Although gardeners value ladybugs and will sometimes purchase them to consume plant-destroying aphids, thousands are needed for complete control, and they will only stick around for a major aphid infestation. If there are not enough aphids, they will fly elsewhere in search of food.

The telling and reading of stories to children in early years, before they have mastered the art of reading, is of such importance as to awaken the serious thought of parents and teachers. To older people it is a source of constant surprise—the attentive interest which children bestow upon stories. Almost any kind of a story will command their wide-awake thought. But the tale which they can fully understand and enjoy has a unique power to concentrate their mental energy. There is an undivided, unalloyed absorption of mind in good stories which augurs well for all phases of later effort. To get children into this habit of undivided mental energy, of singleness of purpose in study, is most promising. In primary grades, the fluttering, scatter-brained truancy of thought is the chronic obstacle to success in study.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

In a society that tends to celebrate the outgoing, expressive traits of the extrovert, quiet-natured introverts often get overlooked or, worse yet, are mistakenly perceived as aloof, arrogant, or even antisocial. Even introverts often view their unshakeable introversion as a thing to overcome. The truth is, introversion—which at its root is the preference for environments of lower stimulation—is not a character flaw at all. It can in fact be a favorable trait even in positions of leadership, where the extrovert ideal is especially valued. Abraham Lincoln, perhaps one of the greatest leaders in United States history, was an introvert. Other great introverted figures in history include Eleanor Roosevelt, Mahatma Gandhi, and Albert Einstein, who once said “the monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind.” Despite the many benefits of introversion—independence, ability to focus, and creativity—educational institutions and workplaces today still exhibit a preference for extroversion.

In discussing introverts, the author’s primary focus is on their

Though [Jane Austen’s] novels are novels of sentiment, they never drift into sickly sentiment, they are wholesome and healthy throughout. With tragedy she had nothing to do; her work is comedy, pure comedy from beginning to end. And as comedies well done are the most recreative of all forms of reading, it is no wonder that, slight as are her plots, hardly to be considered, minute as are the incidents, the attention of readers should ever be kept alive. In all her books marriage is the supreme end; the meeting, the obstacles, the gradual surmounting of these, and the happy ending occur with the regularity of clockwork. And yet each one differs from all the others, and she is never monotonous. Every single book ends well, and it is a striking fact that there is not a death in one of them.

The back sides of the paper bills were printed in green, which eventually led to the nickname “greenbacks” to refer to printed currency. Green ink was most likely used to deter photographic counterfeits, since the cameras of the time could only produce black and white images. By the late 1920s, the U.S. government began making changes to the currency. To begin with, it reduced the size of printed money to save on production costs and introduced standardized designs for each currency amount. Although by this time cameras were able to capture color, the green-colored ink continued to be used because it was widely available, relatively durable, and the color had come to represent stability. Over time, the light green shade became strongly associated with U.S. currency, which is one of the primary reasons the color is still used today.

According to the passage, the U.S. government reduced the size of paper money in order to

At the Democratic convention in Chicago, Hubert Humphrey, who was supported by the party leaders, managed to secure enough delegates to win the nomination even though he hadn’t won a single primary. This caused a deep rift within the Democratic Party, and many people, particularly those who opposed Humphrey’s support of the Vietnam War, protested the nomination. In an attempt to improve the way future candidates were chosen, Democratic Party leaders formed the McGovern-Fraser Commission. In order to maximize participation among voters, the commission recommended the party require state party leaders to provide a 30-day notice prior to hosting primaries or caucuses. As a result of that requirement, states now schedule presidential primaries from as early as February to as late as June.

The first step in creating lavender-infused oil is to take several sprigs of fresh lavender and cut them up into small pieces. Next, strip the flowers from the stems, and lightly crush the flowers to bring out their fragrance. Place the stems and crumbled lavender flowers into a glass jar and pour olive oil in it to cover the lavender parts, being sure to leave some space at the top to account for expansion. Now seal the jar and let the mixture sit for up to one month in a window that receives plenty of sunlight. When the time is up, use a strainer or cheesecloth to strain the oil, extracting as much oil as possible from the lavender pieces.

She made a list of her top three destinations to consider: New Orleans, Louisiana; Boston, Massachusetts; and Washington, D.C. For years, Nadia had wanted to visit childhood friends who lived in New Orleans. However, the trip she was planning would occur in July, when the weather would likely be hot and rainy. Boston was a viable option because she could easily drive to the city from her home in Stowe, Vermont. But her sister and family would be moving to Boston next month, so Nadia was likely to go there soon anyway. Finally, although hotels in Washington, D.C., were slightly more expensive than she had budgeted and the weather could be hot and humid, there were numerous free historic sites to visit. It didn’t take long before Nadia made a decision and began to make travel plans.

Which of the following statements about Nadia does the passage suggest?

A.	She works studying the history of Stowe, Vermont.
B.	She will visit Washington, D.C., in July.
C.	She grew up with her sister in Boston.
D.	She lived in New Orleans as a child.

Day was just breaking when their three wagons, drawn by stout mules, wheeled briskly into place, and as the sun came up and they saw the [wagon] train stretching out ahead of them, they felt afresh the inspiration of their common hope in this peaceful conquest of fortune. A wave of joyous exultation seemed to sweep along the line; whips cracked, the mounted men galloped to and fro; while out of the uncertain light beyond, as the sun crept up above the horizon, the white lurching tops of the great wagons burst into view, one by one; but growing always smaller until finally they became mere white specks, dropping back in the track of the receding mist.

He spent hours asking his neighbors about their livestock and enjoyed watching grazing animals of all kinds in the fields near his home. As he grew older, he researched raising wool-producing sheep, and he figured he could translate his passion into a sustainable business with hard work and a good piece of pastureland. In his early 20s, Gene worked on sheep ranches for six years, saving his money and learning all he could about sheep. Then, just before he turned 27, with a small loan from his parents, Gene was able to purchase a 40-acre ranch close to his hometown. Here, he eventually built up his flock to 130 sheep, which according to his family and friends produces the finest wool in the state.

During each night it grew cold. The leaves, after their blaze and riot of color, turned crisp and crackly and brown. Some of the little, still puddles were filmed with what was almost, but not quite ice. A sheen of frost whitened the house roofs and silvered each separate blade of grass on the lawns. But by noon the sun, rising red in the veil of smoke that hung low in the snappy air, had mellowed the atmosphere until it lay on the cheek like a caress. No breath of wind stirred. Sounds came clearly from a distance. Long V-shaped flights of geese swept athwart the sky, very high up, but their honking came faintly to the ear. And yet, when the sun, swollen to the great dimensions of the rising moon, dipped blood-red through the haze; the first premonitory tingle of cold warned one that the grateful warmth of the day had been but an illusion of a season that had gone.

She didn’t mind too much that the days were getting shorter and the sky turned dark by the time she returned home from work. Every September, Ella looked forward to retrieving from the attic her heavier clothes stashed away with the arrival of spring. Feeling the weight of her favorite knit sweater or fleece jacket was like sinking into a familiar and comforting embrace. Rifling through the pockets of her winter coats, untouched for months, was like a treasure hunt. She would often find shopping lists and receipts, and once she even found a twenty-dollar bill.

The month was June and all the world seemed soft and sweet and joyous. To the right flowed a turbulent mountain stream, boiling savagely with the alien waters of the flood season. Ahead of the creaking coach rode four horsemen, all heavily armed; another quartette followed some distance in the rear. At the side of the coach an officer of the Russian mounted police was riding easily, jangling his accoutrements with a vigor that disheartened at least one occupant of the vehicle. The windows of the coach doors were lowered, permitting the fresh mountain air to caress fondly the face of the young woman who tried to find comfort in one of the broad seats.

Peter called its course its “rise in life”—so obvious was its snobbery, its persistent climbing; but his ridicule was the tolerant ridicule of affection.

Both of these types of water heaters can be powered by natural gas, propane, fuel oil, or electricity, and each type has its advantages and disadvantages. Heating water only when it is needed, tankless water heaters typically use less energy than storage tank water heaters, which need to work continually to keep the stored water at a set temperature. Yet, despite this drawback, storage tank water heaters generally have a higher flow rate. In other words, they are typically better equipped than tankless water heaters to accommodate large households running multiple appliances simultaneously. Moreover, tankless water heaters can cost more up front. So, when selecting a new water heater, be sure to consider fuel type, energy efficiency, operating costs, and household needs. 

According to the passage, compared to a tankless water heater, a storage tank water heater generally

Born in Mississippi in 1897, Faulkner exhibited artistic inclinations in childhood by writing poetry and drawing. His early poems were inspired by Scottish and English poets such as Robert Burns and A. E. Housman. However, amid the era of World War I, Faulkner put his writing on hold to join the war effort in 1918 as a cadet in training, only to return to his hometown that same year because the war ended. In 1919, Faulkner enrolled in college and published his first poem in The New Republic and went on to write stories and poems for the college newspaper, The Mississippian. In 1924, Faulkner’s first book of poetry The Marble Faun was published. However, it would be another two years, in 1926, before Faulkner would publish his first novel, Soldiers’ Pay.

All the parts of the brain work together, but each part has its own special properties. Each cerebral hemisphere can be divided into sections, or lobes, each of which specializes in different functions. To understand each lobe and its specialty we will take a tour of the cerebral hemispheres, starting with the two frontal lobes, which lie directly behind the forehead. When you plan a schedule, imagine the future, or use reasoned arguments, these two lobes do much of the work. One of the ways the frontal lobes seem to do these things is by acting as short-term storage sites, allowing one idea to be kept in mind while other ideas are considered. In the rearmost portion of each frontal lobe is a motor area, which helps control voluntary movement. A nearby place on the left frontal lobe called Broca’s area allows thoughts to be transformed into words.

The only individual entirely unexcited, was my escort, who never for a moment lost the appearance of sangfroid and indifference that an earthquake would not have startled him out of, I was convinced. Though we did not hurry, we were, before many of our fellow-voyagers, in possession of the best seats… Mr. Rutledge was emphatically a good traveler, carrying the clear-sighted precision and deliberation of his mind into all the details of travel, and thereby securing himself from the petty annoyances that people often think unworthy of attention, but which do more than they suspect, toward marring pleasure and destroying comfort. 

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about Mr. Rutledge is correct? 

A.	He is discourteous to others.
B.	He is thrilled to be traveling.
C.	He is the first passenger on board.
D.	He is well prepared for the journey.

First, start with one of Detroit’s world-renown museums, taking your pick of everything from fine art to the making of iconic American cars to the Motown music experience. After exploring a museum or two, you can satisfy your appetite and relax at one of the city’s many fine restaurants in the downtown area. The impressive variety of affordable and delicious fare includes ethnic cuisines as well as regional favorites, which often feature locally-sourced ingredients. Finally, end your day with a walk along the Detroit River. In my experience, the best time to visit the bustling, historic riverfront is in the early evening, just as the sun is about to set. A day spent touring the museums, sampling the food, and enjoying a leisurely river-view walk is one that is sure to satisfy.

The author most likely wrote the passage about Detroit in order to

A.	teach the reader about its history. 
B.	share a story about a visit there.
C.	offer advice on things to do.
D.	recommend when to visit.

As I waited patiently at the trailhead for my friend to show up, I noticed some of the wildflowers around the park. I knew the yellow ones near the trees were a type of violet and the blue ones growing in the open meadow were called sky lupine, but there were many more I could not identify. The wildflowers closest to the trail appeared the healthiest. In fact, even though the rainy season was just concluding, many of the wildflowers growing in direct sunlight had already withered. When my friend finally arrived, we slipped on jackets and were soon tackling the switchbacks that snaked along the hillside.

According to the passage, the wildflowers that appeared healthiest in the park were

A.	in the open meadow. 
B.	closest to the trail. 
C.	along the hillside.

The rugged grandeur of the Tetons is a product of four geologic factors: the tough hard rocks in the core, the amount of vertical uplift, the recency of the mountain-making movement, and the dynamic forces of destruction. Many other mountains in Wyoming have just as hard rocks in their cores and an equally great amount of vertical uplift, but they rose 50 to 60 million years ago and have been worn down by erosion from that time on. The Tetons, on the other hand, are the youngest range in Wyoming, less than 10 million years old, and have not had time to be so deeply eroded.

According to the passage, compared to the Tetons, other mountains in Wyoming with similar cores

A.	are composed of softer rocks.
B.	were less recently formed.
C.	had greater vertical uplift.
D.	are younger in age.

I mentioned I had signed up for the course to learn how to make different sauces. Lorenzo excitedly commented he wanted to experiment with world cuisines. Krista chimed in and said she had never been taught how to cook and was looking forward to becoming more self-sufficient in the kitchen. Todd was taking the class to refine his kitchen management skills—he had been working as an assistant chef at a nearby restaurant for almost a year. Suzanne noted she had signed up as soon as she learned the course would cover baking and pastry techniques. After six weeks, we left the class not only with a new set of cooking skills but also with a new set of friends.

I started out with ballet because I found the combination of discipline and artistic expression intriguing. As I got older, I experimented with hip-hop for a few years. Unwilling to travel, my interest in that faded when my dance troupe decided to enter regional and state dance competitions. Next, I turned my attentions closer to home and explored the variety of Native American dances used by my people to mark important events. At about the same time, my brother introduced me to jazz dancing. Dancing, no matter what the style, is an art that I enjoy, and learning new routines is always a welcome challenge.

Executing an intricately choreographed dance, the glassblowers maintained a concerted focus on their own tasks while also remaining acutely aware of what the other artisans were doing. Each time the glass was reheated and reshaped, all attention shifted to the master glassblower and the glowing creation taking shape under her direction. When the glass, which had taken the form of a large donut-shaped sculpture, had finally achieved just the right shape and thickness, it was removed from the rod, and two more artisans performed the final grinding and polishing before the piece was deemed finished. Timing was critical, and it was obvious this team of glassblowers had worked closely with one another for a long time.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with this delicacy, durian is a large, spiky fruit native to Malaysia and Indonesia. Although durian tastes divine, it smells a lot like stinky cheese. My friends claim the nickname is a tribute to my willingness to try new and exotic foods. Since I own a restaurant and often experiment with different recipes and ingredients, I suppose, in that sense, the name is appropriate for me. The nickname eventually became known to my family, and now even my kitchen staff has picked up on it. In fact, only a few people call me Julian anymore. Over time, I have grown used to my nickname and consider it evidence of my love for bringing unusual foods to the table.

They followed Trail 6 for four miles, stopping a few times along the way to admire the scenery. Just before taking a left turn onto Trail 2, they stopped to have a picnic lunch. Then they got back on their bikes and headed inland until they reached Trail 5. After about 10 miles on this trail, they noticed storm clouds in the distance and decided to head back, taking a shortcut on Trail 4 to the parking lot.

She sat down and didn’t bother to look at the menu. Instead, she told the server her usual order, soup and a salad. Caroline opened her laptop and began typing. As fast as she could—which was an impressive sixty words per minute—Caroline hammered out several paragraphs. She eyed the clock. It was already a little past eleven, and she still needed to write the conclusion. This time, she thought she’d create a poignant ending rather than a happy one. She pictured in her mind the two main characters parting ways on a still beach below the Mayan ruins and promising to meet there again in twenty years. When her order arrived, Caroline devoured her meal and immediately returned to her story, submitting it just before the clock struck twelve.

Even when a dream is remembered, it is often impossible to interpret the dream’s meaning, especially if it consists of unconnected and incoherent events. Some dreams are so rich and vivid that when dreamers first awaken, they can be disoriented. It might even take a few moments to distinguish what is real from the dream itself. However, despite the mysterious and elusive nature of dreams, many people take them seriously enough to spend considerable effort attempting to interpret them, because they believe understanding their dreams can help process the emotions and events that make up their waking lives.

However, there are occasions when I make the decision to return the text to the bookshelf and move on to another prospect. This decision is usually a result of my disdain for unsympathetic characters, poor grammar and editing, or a plot so predictable or mundane that I quickly lose focus and interest. Books that I don’t finish sadden me with their unfulfilled promise, and I admit that I spend time contemplating how I would have written them differently. For example, if I had written them, they would be bestselling, page-turning literary classics instead of makeshift coasters on my coffee table.

As his fingers slid gracefully across the keys and his feet worked the pedals, his troubles faded into the background. When he played, the powerful sound of the music never failed to ease his mind and quell his lingering worries.

We just returned from a visit to a hotel with a green roof designed to provide shade and reduce temperatures of the roof surface and surrounding air. You talked about how these roofs can absorb heat and act as insulators for a building, and we were told the hotel did indeed experience decreased utility bills due to the reduced energy needed to provide cooling and heating. We also noticed better-than-expected indoor comfort, despite the major heat wave underway. I’m not sure what kinds of green roofs can be installed on private residences, but the one we saw included trees and shrubs in addition to basic groundcover. Maybe you could start simply, with a two-inch covering of hardy groundcover. Let me know if you decide to build it.

[The Declaration of London] was due largely to Sir Edward Grey. He summoned the chief maritime nations to a conference on the subject in December, 1908; the conference sat for less than three months, and in February, 1909, made a report which was embodied in the Declaration of London. It was greatly discussed and eventually rejected in the British Parliament. It was not, I believe, even proposed anywhere else. As a matter of fact, the Declaration did not fully satisfy anyone. It was certainly a move in the right direction, but there were two large objections to it. First, many international lawyers—Professor Holland was one of them—considered that it had been drawn too hastily and was not a satisfactory legal code. Secondly, its desirability or undesirability depended partly on certain large political problems which were obscure in 1909. They are anything but obscure now.

The author most likely wrote the passage about the Declaration of London in order to

A.	criticize its weaknesses.

Distinct from the colossal squid, which is slightly shorter with a larger, heavier body, giant squid can acquire food up to 33 feet away. They do this with their two feeding tentacles, armed with sharp-toothed suckers that shoot out to capture prey. In fact, a giant squid’s tentacles can measure two times the combined length of its arms and main body. The colossal squid’s tentacles, in contrast, are armed with both suckers and hooks. After their food has been obtained, colossal and giant squid rely on their sharp internal beaks and tooth-lined radula—an organ similar to a tongue—to break down their meal, though the colossal squid has the larger beak. There are hundreds of species of squid, but these two garner much attention due to their impressive size.

According to the passage, compared to the colossal squid, the giant squid has

Nothing is more offensive to the eye of a good judge of printing than bad spacing. “Rivers” of white, dark spots, crowded black text, are very serious blemishes to a page. An ordinary book page is a study in color, the colors employed being black and white. Proper combination, balance, and proportion are as important here as in places where a variety of colors is employed. Many of the foregoing rules must be held subject to the exigencies of proper spacing. A rigid adherence, for example, to the rule that not more than two consecutive lines should end with divided words will not justify a badly spaced, unsightly line. There are many things that look worse than a hyphen at the end of the last full line in a paragraph. Avoidance of dividing the last word on a page, however, would justify even bad spacing, because of the gain to the reader. In the last resort, the interests of the reader must always have first consideration.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Hyphens must only be used twice on any page. 
B.	Proper spacing relies upon strict adherence to rules.

For example, tasks include ensuring compliance with federal and state guidelines, establishing a board of directors, and developing a mission statement. It often also entails assembling and managing a team of dedicated volunteers; many nonprofit directors end up hiring a professional volunteer manager to run their volunteer programs. In addition to overseeing, recruiting, and training volunteers, the volunteer manager takes the time to assess the skills of volunteers before assigning them to a particular position within the organization. This is especially important when volunteers perform duties that, similar to those of paid staff, require a high degree of expertise or responsibility. Moreover, volunteer managers are well aware that sustaining a successful volunteer program requires listening to and rewarding volunteers in order to maintain their enthusiasm and ensure their continued support.

Rainwater is seldom pure. It carries in it carbonic acid; and that acid, beating in shower after shower against the face of a cliff—especially if it be a limestone cliff—weathers the rock chemically; changing (in case of limestone) the insoluble carbonate of lime into a soluble bicarbonate, and carrying that away in water, which, however clear, is still hard. Hard water is usually water which has invisible lime in it; there are from ten to fifteen grains and more of lime in every gallon of limestone water. I leave you to calculate the enormous weight of lime which must be so carried down to the sea every year by a single limestone or chalk brook. … you will be astonished to find it one not of many pounds, but probably of many tons, of solid lime, which you never suspected or missed from the hills around.

When I was a child we lived on the border of the town, and the road that passed our windows went in two ways. One branch ran up the hill under the old city gateway and out through the mean city “lanes.” The other branch turned round our corner and ran into the countryside. Day and night many carts lumbered by our windows, in plain hearing. In the daytime I took no pleasure in them, but when I awoke at night and the thick silence was broken by the noise of a single deliberate cart it filled me with vague enchantment. I still feel this enchantment. The steady effort of the wheels, their rattle as they passed over the uneven road, their crunching deliberateness, gives me a sense of acute pleasure.

For target archery, a modern recurve bow is popular with beginners due to its unique shape, because it is powerful without requiring a great deal of strength to draw the bow. Whereas, the compound bow, with its system of multiple strings, pulleys, and cams, is not typically used by beginners due to its complexity. The simplest bow of all, in terms of design, is the traditional longbow, which is made from a single piece of solid or laminated wood. However, its simplicity—it lacks even a simple arrow rest or sight—also makes it the most challenging bow to master, because it is very difficult to aim. Another traditional type of bow often used for target archery is the crossbow, easily recognized by its short, horizontal bow attached to a stock. Regardless of the type of bow used, the archer’s common objective is to accurately hit the bull’s-eye on the target.

According to the passage, the most challenging type of bow to master is the

A.	crossbow.
B.	compound bow.
C.	traditional longbow.
D.	modern recurve bow.

The BCD is inflatable and allows divers to control their buoyancy throughout the dive. Another crucial piece of equipment is the scuba tank, which contains the diver’s air supply and is usually carried on the BCD. A diver’s lifeline to the air supply is the regulator, which lowers the high-pressure air in the scuba tank to ambient pressure, thereby allowing the diver to breathe freely underwater. A standard dive computer is valuable for keeping track of the time spent underwater, and it gauges depth and monitors ascent rate. For overnight excursions, a compact air compressor is useful for refilling empty scuba tanks. All of this equipment helps ensure divers’ physical safety and comfort.

According to the passage, which of the following lowers the air pressure from the tank to the diver?

A.	regulator
B.	compressor
C.	dive computer
D.	buoyancy control device

Although many oaks are deciduous, losing their leaves annually, this type of tree is green throughout the year because it replaces its leaves in the spring right after losing them. Due to their evergreen appearance, these trees are commonly called “live oaks” or “Southern live oaks.” Southern live oaks are found from Virginia south to Florida, along the Gulf Coast, and as far west as Texas and Oklahoma, thriving in these regions due to the warm weather and salty soils. It takes the Southern live oak about seventy years to achieve its maximum trunk diameter of about six feet, and experts estimate some of the oldest Southern live oaks in the United States are about one thousand years old. With their massive trunks and broad sweeping limbs, these rugged giants have become icons of the American South.

Based on the passage, Quercus virginiana earned its common name because the tree

A.	lives for hundreds of years.
B.	looks green all year long.
C.	grows a very large trunk.

So, Levi obtained from his new neighbors several recommendations for orchards where you could pick your own fruit, and he chose one about an hour’s drive away. Later that afternoon, before he called the orchard to confirm their hours of operation, he read up on what kinds of apples were best suited for baking. Then, before loading several large wicker baskets into his car, he planned his driving route. When he arrived at the orchard the next day, he watched a short video about best practices for picking before getting started. He harvested nearly 10 pounds of apples of different varieties.

“Dog in the manger”—what did that mean exactly? He had heard the phrase more than once, but had never stopped to consider it in any way. Yet it was a plain sort of illustration, carrying its own meaning along with it. Harry had once been staying in the country with some cousins at a farmhouse called Clover Hollow, and he remembered them all laughing one day at “Grip,” a little Skye terrier, that had got into one of the mangers in the stable, and kept at a respectable distance the good old pony to which it belonged, barking at him and refusing to allow him the enjoyment of his own breakfast. And Grip could not, of course, enjoy it himself—chopped hay and oats not being at all in his line. Seemingly, the only pleasure Grip derived from this performance lay in keeping “Donald,” the old pony, from having any breakfast! 

The passage suggests the phrase “dog in the manger” refers to a person who

A.	begrudges others something useless to that person.
B.	makes unfavorable situations even worse for that person.
C.	refuses to accept something that person knows to be true.

Although some scholars disagree about the number of universal characteristics of human language—some cite six, while others claim as many as thirteen—they tend to agree on the following three features all languages possess. First, the property of arbitrariness describes the lack of connection between the definition or meaning of words and their sounds or forms. For example, the word bird has no connection with the actual animal in either sound or appearance. However, onomatopoeias, or words that sound similar to what they mean (buzz, for instance) are exceptions to this rule. Another property of language, displacement, describes the ability of language to communicate about past and future events as opposed to being limited to events that are happening in the moment. Lastly, the property of productivity describes the infinite potential of human language—that is, the capacity of language to expand the communication of new ideas. These three key properties are shared by all human languages.

According to the passage, the property of displacement includes the

A.	capacity of language to expand the communication of new ideas.
B.	lack of connection between the definition and form of words.
C.	ability of language to communicate about future events.
D.	use of words that sound similar to what they mean.

Cane is the name applied to a great number of plants which possess long, slender, reed-like stems. The name should apply only to a class of palms called rattans. These plants are found throughout the Indian Archipelago, China, India, Ceylon, and the Malay Peninsula. They grow in dense, dark forests and form a matted undergrowth which makes passage difficult or impossible. These palms are trailing in tendency, yet frequently grow to tree height. They then fall over and lie on the ground. The stem is covered with beautiful green foliage, grows to a length of 100 to 300 feet, and rarely exceeds 1 inch in diameter. The stems are cut into lengths of 10 to 20 feet for export. The outer bark is stripped into widths varying from 1/16 to 3/16 inch. These strips are put into hanks of 1,000 lineal feet each.

The winter of 186768 will count among the severest recorded in meteorological annals. As early as the winter solstice the cold began to make itself felt. In a few days the centigrade thermometer sank to 12° below zero, through the influence of a very keen north-east wind. At Paris, where, on an average, the winter temperature is two degrees higher than in the surrounding country, the Seine was completely frozen for upwards of a fortnight. To meet with a similar phenomenon we must go back as far as 1788. In January 1830, when, on the 17th, the temperature sank down to 17°, the Seine was also frozen, but the ice speedily melted. The extreme cold of 1788 coincides, like that of 1830, with the appearance of two comets. In bringing together these and other similar facts, some writers are induced to believe themselves authorized in establishing theories which attribute a certain frigorific [chilling] influence to the comets.

Knowing, then, a little of the vast world of plant beauty quite shut out of our gardens by the “system,” in vogue, I was led to consider the ways in which it might be introduced to our gardens; and, among various ideas that then occurred to me, was the name and scope of the “wild garden.” I was led to think of the enormous number of beautiful hardy plants from other countries which might be naturalized, with a very slight amount of trouble, in many situations in our gardens and woods—a world of delightful plant beauty that we might in this way make happy around us, in places now weedy, or half bare, or useless.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	unsatisfactory popular methods of gardening.
B.	distinction between wild gardens and formal ones.
C.	need to replace outdated borders of mixed flowers.
D.	introduction of sturdy nonnative plants in open spaces.

The chests of the Jacobean time, enriched with moldings, paneling, and drop ornaments, are by no means unknown in America. They are furnished with drawers, cupboards, and then drawers above, making them massive and useful pieces of furniture. They stand upon large round legs, and the handles to drawers and cupboards are drops. In Italy marriage chests were beautifully painted, often by famous masters, and sometimes gilded as well. In Holland the chests were carved or inlaid; and many of these, owing to the commercial relations between England and Holland, found their way into the former country and thence to America, in addition to those brought directly from the Low Countries.

According to the passage, chests from Holland were

A.	inlaid.
B.	painted.
C.	sometimes gilded.
D.	designed by famous masters.

The library had just instituted a new policy that limited patrons to having only three books out at a time, so Briana knew she would have to be selective in her choices. In the fiction section, she grabbed a new novel her friend highly recommended. Then she walked over to the poetry section and found one of her favorite collections, Pablo Neruda’s Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, which she rereads about once a year. After that, she selected The Life of Abraham Lincoln by Henry Ketcham and a book featuring guidelines for writing travel memoirs. Now it was time to decide. Briana reassured herself that Neruda’s poetry collection was still among the stack of books in her arms as she approached the circulation desk.

The passage suggests that Briana will most likely

A.	decide to check out the book of poetry.
B.	write a book about her vacation experience.
C.	end up reading only one book while on vacation.
D.	persuade the librarian to make an exception to the rules.

Reducing or, better yet, refusing plastic can significantly decrease our impact on the environment. For starters, take your own reusable shopping and produce bags with you to the grocery store. Eliminate the use of plastic drinking straws at home and in restaurants by purchasing your own reusable ones made of stainless steel or glass. Also, did you know that most chewing gum is made of synthetic rubber, which means plastic? If you can’t bring yourself to give up gum, there are a few brands that are made of natural rubber. Finally, avoid unnecessary plastic packaging by purchasing foods such as cereals and nuts from the bulk bins in your supermarket. If you institute just one of these measures every few weeks, you will drastically reduce your plastic waste in no time!

Which of the following best describes the main idea of the passage?

A.	People usually discard plastic products after their first use.
B.	People ought to purchase food items in bulk when possible.
C.	People should replace single-use plastic items with alternatives.
D.	People may find it initially inconvenient to reduce plastic waste.

All day long, Daria had felt tired and run down, but she was determined to make herself a home-cooked meal. Daria wearily flipped through the recipes and was tempted to just order a pizza. After all, if she cooked something herself, she probably wouldn’t have all of the ingredients and would have to go out and buy something. Then, she came across a recipe for black bean soup that required two cans of black beans, chicken broth, chopped onion, yellow and green bell pepper, and diced tomatoes. It wouldn’t have been her first choice perhaps, but she just happened to have all of those ingredients on hand. The preparation took less time than Daria anticipated, and once everything was combined in the pot, she had time to unwind for 20 minutes while the soup simmered. When the soup was finished, Daria sat down and enjoyed a warm, nourishing meal that truly lifted her spirits.

Daria most likely chose the soup recipe because it

A.	seemed like it would be simple to prepare.
B.	seemed more appealing than eating pizza.
C.	would save her a trip to the grocery store.

Gunther enjoyed almost every aspect of flying—from the scrupulous pre-flight check of the aircraft to the takeoff and landing, the latter of which he felt was more complicated. Looking down from his position in the cockpit, he was just as enthralled with the view as he was during his first solo flight 10 years ago. The feeling of freedom when he flew was like no other, but at the same time he felt a strong sense of responsibility as the sole person in charge of the airplane. Each flight seemed to renew his enthusiasm, and he vowed to fly more often. He hoped someday one or both of his daughters would carry on the flying tradition.

Angela and the other friends felt Melissa wasn’t doing her share of the work. Angela was getting very close to confronting Melissa about her lack of help, especially when Melissa disappeared just as it was time to clean up after dinner.

On Friday night in the midst of the most intense and general interest and curiosity, heightened by the closeness and fidelity with which the Government measures had been kept secret, Peel brought forward his financial plans in a speech of three hours and forty minutes, acknowledged by everybody to have been a masterpiece of financial statement. The success was complete; he took the House by storm; and his opponents, though of course differing and objecting on particular points, did him ample justice. A few people expected an income tax, but the majority did not. Hitherto the Opposition have been talking very big about opposing all taxes, but they have quite altered their tone. It is really remarkable to see the attitude Peel has taken in this Parliament, his complete mastery over both his friends and his foes.

Nevertheless, Yolanda was thrilled to have come this far. She had given numerous presentations and had applied for several grants to support this project, knowing the outcome could possibly lead to a critical new theory.

The genus Prunus plays a very important part in horticulture. It furnishes, in temperate climates, the stone-fruits, plants of ancient and modern agriculture of which there are a score or more commonly cultivated and at least as many more sparingly grown for their edible fruits. Of these stone-fruits the species of cherries rank with those of the plum and the peach in commercial importance while the several botanical groups of the apricot and almond are less important, but hardly less well-known, members of this notable genus. Prunus is of interest, too, because the history of its edible species follows step by step the history of agriculture. The domestication of its fruits from wild progenitors, most of which are still subjects of common observation, illustrates well the influences and conditions under which plants have generally been brought into domestication. 

In the passage, the author’s purpose is most likely to

These were now heavily mortgaged but he hoped to save them. They moved into a large house which had been a tavern in the days when lumber had been cut around Hardscrabble. It was disappointing after their fine brick house in Battenville, but they made it comfortable, and their love for and loyalty to each other made them a happy family anywhere.

Striking through the thought of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith’s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or nearby— it seemed both. Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell.

By the middle of the second day he had been running continuously for thirty hours, and the iron of his flesh was giving out. It was the endurance of his mind that kept him going. He had not eaten in forty hours, and he was weak with hunger. The repeated drenchings in the icy water had likewise had their effect on him. His handsome coat was draggled. The broad pads of his feet were bruised and bleeding. He had begun to limp, and this limp increased with the hours. To make it worse, the light of the sky was obscured and snow began to fall—a raw, moist, melting, clinging snow, slippery under foot, that hid from him the landscape he traversed, and that covered over the inequalities of the ground so that the way of his feet was more difficult and painful.

And, first of all, there is a buzzing in the ears, a dazzlement in the eyes. Above our heads is a double ogive vault, paneled with wood carving, painted azure, and sown with golden fleurs-de-lis; beneath our feet a pavement of black and white marble, alternating. A few paces distant, an enormous pillar, then another, then another; seven pillars in all, down the length of the hall, sustaining the spring of the arches of the double vault, in the center of its width. Around four of the pillars, stalls of merchants, all sparkling with glass and tinsel; around the last three, benches of oak, worn and polished by the trunk hose of the litigants, and the robes of the attorneys.

The narrator describes the setting largely in terms of its

The morning sun was streaming through the crevices of the canvas when the man awoke. A warm glow pervaded the whole atmosphere of the marquee [tent], and a single big blue fly buzzed musically round and round it. Besides the buzz of the fly there was not a sound. He looked about—at the benches—at the table supported by trestles—at his basket of tools—at the stove where the furmity had been boiled—at the empty basins—at some shed grains of wheat—at the corks which dotted the grassy floor. Among the odds and ends he discerned a little shining object, and picked it up. It was his wife’s ring.

There was no longer the moon to guide her steps across the familiar pathway to the cabin. The brightest light in the sky was Venus, that swung low in the east. The bats had ceased to beat their wings about the ruin. Even the mockingbird that had warbled for hours in the old mulberry tree had sung himself asleep. That darkest hour before the day was mantling the earth. Ma’ame Pelagie hurried through the wet, clinging grass, beating aside the heavy moss that swept across her face, walking on toward the cabin—toward Pauline. Not once did she look back upon the ruin that brooded like a huge monster—a black spot in the darkness that enveloped it.

Although North Dakota cannot boast of large mountain ranges like the states farther west, it is anything but a flat, monotonous state. Much of the state is characterized by gently rolling prairie. More noticeable hills and escarpments may be found in the Turtle Mountains, Pembina Hills, on the south side of Devils Lake, and along stretches of several rivers (notably the Missouri). Further, beach lines and sand hills left over from the last ice age provide a somewhat local variation to the level topography of some areas. The most rugged terrain occurs in the Little Missouri badlands, which are characterized by numerous steep slopes, severely eroded buttes, and arroyos.

The author describes North Dakota largely in terms of

A.	its distinction from other states. 
B.	the features of its terrain.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I sank into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in.  I had so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavored to make on towards the land as fast as I could before another wave should return and take me up again; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to contend with.

Beautiful things seem to put us in correspondence with a world the harmonies of which are more perfect, and bring a deeper peace than this imperfect life seems capable of yielding of itself. Our moments of peace are, I think, always associated with some form of beauty, of this spark of harmony within corresponding with some infinite source without. Like a mariner’s compass, we are restless until we find repose in this one direction. In moments of beauty (for beauty is, strictly speaking, a state of mind rather than an attribute of certain objects, although certain things have the power of inducing it more than others) we seem to get a glimpse of this deeper truth behind the things of sense.

He was in a long, straight street, peopled by a mere fraction of an immense multitude; but all round him, on and on, even to the limits of the horizon hidden by the enormous piles of bricks, he felt the mass of mankind mighty in its numbers.

The road ran about like a wild thing, avoiding the deep draws, crossing them where they were wide and shallow. And all along it, wherever it looped or ran, the sunflowers grew; some of them were as big as little trees, with great rough leaves and many branches which bore dozens of blossoms. They made a gold ribbon across the prairie. Occasionally one of the horses would tear off with his teeth a plant full of blossoms, and walk along munching it, the flowers nodding in time to his bites as he ate down toward them.

He remembered he had so often cursed the brindle cow and her mates, and had sometimes flung milking stools. But, from his present point of view, there was a halo of happiness about each of their heads, and he would have sacrificed all the brass buttons on the continent to have been enabled to return to them.

My mother solved the problem by giving it as her wish that I should be called after her mother, whose maiden name was Helen Everett. But in the excitement of carrying me to church my father lost the name on the way, very naturally, since it was one in which he had declined to have a part.

This is in part because most pears ripen from the inside out, and they ripen best after they have been harvested. Unlike most other fruit varieties, pears are picked once they are fully grown, but before they start to ripen. To tell if a pear is ready to be picked, some growers will hold the fruit in a horizontal position, perpendicular to its vertical hanging position. If the pear’s stem easily detaches from the branch, it is ready to be harvested. Once purchased, buyers can complete the ripening process by sealing the pear in a paper bag. After a few days, they can test its ripeness by holding the pear in the palm of one hand and applying gentle pressure to the stem area with the thumb. If the skin gives slightly, the fruit is ripe and ready to eat.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Pears typically ripen from the outside in.
B.	Pears are harvested once they are fully ripened.
C.	Pears ripen rapidly when they are placed on their sides.

One thing and one only, it seemed, [Joseph] desired to realize, and that was birds. It was a passion in him, a mania. He had a yearning desire to understand the mystery of bird-life—not ornithology but birds. Anything to do with birds changed the expression of his face at once; the fat and placid indifference gave way to an emotion that, judging by his expression, caused him a degree of wonder that was almost worship, of happiness nearly painful. Their intense vitality inspired him, their equality stirred respect. Anything to do with their flight, their songs, their eggs, their habits fascinated him. And this fascination he realized. He indulged it furiously, if of necessity secretly, since to study bird-life fields and hedges must be visited without company. But here again he took no particular pains, it seemed. As is usual with an overmastering tendency, his knowledge of his subject was instinctive.

The team will transition to running shoes next, because their numerous types and brands usually take the longest to count. Following those, the next type to be counted will be dress shoes and, finally, water shoes. The low demand for the latter means counting this category should go quickly.

In the autumn of 1908 the Society [the British Ornithologists’ Union]… adopted the suggestion, made by Mr. W. R. Ogilvie-Grant, of celebrating its jubilee by sending an expedition to explore, chiefly from an ornithological point of view, the unknown range of Snow Mountains in Dutch New Guinea. A Committee, whose Chairman was Mr. F. D. Godman, F.R.S., President and one of the surviving original members of the Society, was appointed to organize the expedition, and subscriptions were obtained from members and their friends. The remote destination of the expedition aroused a good deal of public interest. The Royal Geographical Society expressed a desire to share in the enterprise, and it soon became evident that it would be a mistake to limit the object of the expedition to the pursuit of birds only.

When he saw the players step out onto the court, Carson closed the book and watched as they warmed up by stretching and practicing their serves. Carson noticed how, with remarkable accuracy, the players were able to put the ball just where they wanted it to go.

The deer are herbivores, so their sharp canines, unlike those of carnivores, are not used to tear meat. Instead, the male tufted deer use their canine teeth to settle conflicts with other male members of the species. Conflicts usually arise when the males are competing for females during mating season or when vying for territory.

When in danger, the deer bark in alarm and flee to elude their predators.

In nature, there are numerous cases of organisms that belong to different species but provide one another with basic provisions for survival, such as nutrients or even protection from predators. Take, for example, certain species of clownfish and sea anemones. The sea anemone provides a safe shelter for the brightly colored clownfish by not striking them with the poisonous stingers of the anemone’s tentacles, which can paralyze little fish and other sea creatures. Anemones may also supplement the clownfish’s own mucous covering to help protect clownfish from stings. In return, the anemone receives important nutrients, such as nitrogen, through the fish waste produced by the clownfish. Additionally, the clownfish will remove parasites from the anemone’s tentacles and defend the sea anemone from some of its predators. Working together, these sea creatures increase their chances of survival in their ocean environment.

Of still moonlit nights; of windless dusks, with the swell of past storms sullenly remaining; in clammy, breathless weather; with fresh winds blowing our craft to and fro on their way in search of the fish; in blackest gales, when the men of Twist Tickle kept watch for wrecks upon the heads––forever I listened to the voice of the sea before I fell asleep.

Next, for my two old printers and laptops that are no longer functional, I placed all cables and cords in a plastic bag separated from the main components. After removing the cables and cords, I removed from the printers the ink and toner cartridges and placed them in their own plastic bag. Then, I removed batteries from all devices, placed them in a paper bag, and labelled the bag. Finally, to be eligible for a prize, I filled out a raffle card listing my donated items.

This was her first open house since earning her real estate license, and she wanted the home to look and feel as attractive as possible to potential buyers. As soon as she entered the house, she turned on some of the lights and opened all the blinds to make the house look cheery and bright. She also checked all the closets to make sure they were as tidy as possible, and she decluttered the kitchen and bathroom countertops. She then switched on the gas fireplace. Avery had learned from a fellow real estate agent that the warm glow of a lit fireplace makes a home feel more inviting. She finished her preparations by setting out her business cards and a few fliers on the dining room table. Soon enough, the visitors started to arrive, many of them commenting on how nice everything looked. 

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	Avery opened all the blinds to make the home appear brighter.

However, the next time one of your appliances malfunctions, try doing a little research before calling a professional. You just might find that solving the problem yourself is actually fairly easy. Take one example: you walk into the basement and notice a puddle of water at the base of your high-efficiency gas furnace. Don’t panic, the solution could be a simple one. High-efficiency furnaces produce condensation that normally runs through tubing and then exits through a floor drain. However, if dirt gets into the system, it can become clogged, causing water to pool onto the floor. This can be easily addressed by cleaning out the drainage system with a long-handled brush. Of course, if you’re not sure whether you can tackle an appliance problem yourself, be sure to ask a friend or neighbor for the name of a trusted professional. 

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	caution.
B.	instruct.

This campaign event would hopefully serve to highlight some of the major differences between herself and her political opponent. Fortunately, the campaign was a positive one so far, and neither candidate had expressed any animosity toward the other in public speeches or campaign advertisements. In fact, Lucia and her challenger were in agreement on some issues and had even praised one another’s strengths during a town hall debate. Lucia had said her opponent brought some interesting new perspectives to the table, and her fellow candidate admitted Lucia’s twenty years of public service to her community was invaluable. As her speech drew to a close, Lucia reiterated her perspectives one more time and ended on a high note.

Based on the passage, Lucia’s motivation for speaking at the event was to

A.	recount the history of her long career in public office.
B.	highlight her commitment to run a positive campaign.
C.	provide details about her plans for the upcoming term.

Nearly all the genera of this enormous family have species which grow in a temperate climate, if not in the temperate zone. At this moment, in fact, I recall but two exceptions, Vanda and Phalaenopsis. Many more there are, of course—half a dozen have occurred to me while I wrote the last six words—but in the small space at command I must cling to generalities. We have at least a hundred genera which will flourish anywhere if the frost be excluded; and as for species, a list of two thousand would not exhaust them probably.

However, it was the Central Labor Union, not the federal government, that launched the original celebration in 1882 in New York City. Labor Day’s earliest supporters encouraged state legislatures across the country to honor the workforce by publically recognizing its importance to the success and vibrancy of the United States. Over the next 12 years, individual states passed bills creating the Labor Day holiday until Congress’s House Committee on Labor proposed making Labor Day a federal holiday in 1894. While the establishment of Labor Day is not attributed to the work of a single individual, many credit Matthew Maguire, a past secretary for the International Association of Machinists, with the original proposal, while others attribute that honor to Peter McGuire, co-founder of the American Federation of Labor. In any case, ever since its establishment, Labor Day has served as a proud tribute to the American worker.

Since the passing of the holiday bill of 1870, Congress has received hundreds of proposals for new federal holidays, but only a small fraction have been approved, and even some of the approved holidays have undergone changes since their authorization. Thanksgiving Day, for example, was initially observed on the fourth Thursday of November, but President Roosevelt, in 1939, moved the holiday one week earlier to stimulate the economy with a longer holiday shopping season. However, in 1941, in response to protests against the rescheduling, Roosevelt signed legislation that officially established Thanksgiving Day as the fourth Thursday in November. Interestingly, although federal holidays are often referred to as national holidays, they initially applied only to federal employees working in the District of Columbia. It was not until 1885 that federal employees across the nation began receiving the same holiday benefits.

According to the passage, President Roosevelt initially moved Thanksgiving Day earlier by one week in

It was still winter, and the low afternoon sun fell across the avenue from the westward streets in broad golden patches. It was still winter, but the promise of spring was already in the air, and a faint mist hung about the vanishing point of the seemingly endless rows of buildings. The trees were yet far from budding, but the leafless branches no longer looked dead, and the small twigs were growing smooth and glossy with the returning circulation of the sap. There were many people on foot in the avenue, and Totty constantly nodded and smiled to her passing acquaintances, who generally looked with some interest at George as they acknowledged or forestalled his companion’s salutation. He knew a few of them by sight, but not one passed with whom he had ever spoken, and he felt somewhat foolishly ashamed of not knowing every one.

Despite this, Jodi was confident in her abilities, and she wasn’t really concerned that nervousness would impact her performance. In fact, she felt optimistic about the whole thing and was looking forward to performing. Jodi entered the contest primarily for the opportunity to be evaluated by the judges, who were all professional musicians. On the day of the show, Jodi’s performance went well, and she welcomed the expert advice and feedback the judges offered.

The last of the afterglow had all but faded from the sky, and only the faintest twilight, a rose-pink twilight, came into the studio. Rose-pink: he thought of that at once and thought, too, that these sky-roses had a sweeter scent than the roses of earth, for there was about this once-familiar place an odor more delicate and tender than any he had ever known before. It was dim, illusive; it was like a musical poem in an unknown tongue, and yet, unlike French scents and hot-house flowers, it subtly suggested open spaces and mountain-peaks. Cartaret had a quick vision of sunlight upon snow-crests. He wondered how such a perfume could find its way through the narrow, dirty streets of the Latin Quarter and into his poor room. 

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

For the first time since childhood, she could see clearly without her signature polka-dot-framed prescription glasses. She had worn glasses almost her whole life and, though she enjoyed finding stylish ones, had always struggled with what she considered the limitations of wearing them. However, today she was trying on special contact lenses that were custom made for her, and the difference was truly remarkable. Suddenly, the whole world seemed inviting. In addition to swimming and yoga, she could now try new sports like tennis and cycling, and she would no longer need to constantly readjust her heavy glasses as they slipped down her nose.

However, a face-to-face meeting with the leaders of his company was the farthest thing from his mind when he submitted his entry to the company’s annual idea contest last month. For Quinn, his idea seemed like an obvious solution to a problem that strained the company’s project budget each year.

My parents were English, and England was my native land. My father, Mr. Henry Rexton, had been a soldier in his youth; but when he married my mother, who was the daughter of an eminent British merchant, he quit the army; and my grandfather induced him, by advantageous offers, to take a share in his house of business. The firm traded with Peru; and certain mercantile transactions of importance requiring for a time the superintendence of a partner, my father and mother went out there, taking with them me and a younger sister, their only children then born. Year after year unexpected circumstances occurred which compelled them, much against their wish, to remain in the country; and well do I remember how frequently in our family circle the subject of conversation was the happiness we expected to enjoy on returning home.

It had been 7 years since I first joined my father on an expedition to Egypt, where he had permission to carry out an archaeological dig. Ever since he gave me my first trowel when I was 10 years old, I had been imploring him to take me with him. I took to excavation with enthusiasm and was thrilled when our one-year trip was extended by 2 years.

No, it was still there in its folder, the fancy cursive handwriting creating its own kind of art on the page.

She herself had almost ignored it, being more concerned with legal documents than correspondence. Her hands trembled at the thought. This amazing letter, from Annabelle to her sister Amelia, provided a much stronger connection than the tenuous evidence she had been able to find so far between Barton, Amelia’s husband, and a chest of gold missing since the Civil War.

The road started out by hugging the canyon wall in a series of sharp turns bordered by twisted fir trees on one side and sweeping views on the other. Then, the road flattened and straightened out a little, and the firs gave way to a lush canopy of deciduous trees, mostly cottonwoods, sometimes so dense she felt like she was driving through a green tunnel.

Our chef conversed with the guests—telling jokes, mainly—in order to set everyone at ease. At the same time, he laid out his tools, and then the show really started. He cut up vegetables and diced meat faster than I thought was possible. He flipped shrimp tails into the air and caught them in the top of his chef’s hat. He made a miniature volcano out of sliced onion rings and then made it erupt, all the while continuing with his fast-paced banter.

San Francisco, a place where I spent quite a bit of time years ago, has been coming to mind lately. The other day, we had a rare foggy day, which definitely made me think of the “City by the Bay.” That same day, I also saw some new Victorian-style townhomes built on the slope of a hill, which prompted a memory of the iconic Victorian row houses in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco. I don’t know if I would have noticed if it hadn’t been foggy, but the two things together gave me a twinge of nostalgia. Then, just a couple of hours ago, my best friend called and suggested we try the new bakery in town that specializes in—you guessed it—sourdough bread, a famous San Francisco taste treat.

Most of you know him as “Al” or “Dad” or “Grandpa,” but his given name is Alejandro, and he is the eldest of seven children. Because of his birth order, he had a lot of responsibility, but he also had a strong sense of mischief as well. The story goes that his mother had a hard time staying mad at him because he could always make her laugh. Back in the old days, one of the things he did to help earn money for the family was to herd his neighbor’s sheep from one grazing area to another. Sometimes a lamb would get separated from the rest of the flock. When that happened, young Al would imitate the sound of a ewe calling her lamb in order to bring the stray back. To this day, he still makes the most realistic sheep noises I have ever heard.

Because I didn’t know anyone there, one of my mother’s friends very kindly introduced me to her own two daughters who lived in the city. I met up with Maureen and Shannon one day at a music festival. Out of the thousands of people there, we kept running across this man who looked really familiar to me, and he seemed to recognize me as well. Finally, we approached each other and figured out we had worked at the same national park a few summers earlier. While the two of us were talking, Maureen had been chatting with the man’s girlfriend and discovered she was the best friend of Maureen’s former college roommate. It truly is a small world, isn’t it?

However, in the case of one major brand, the product’s creators originally developed it for a very different purpose. Prior to 1860, when Louis Pasteur theorized that invisible germs were responsible for infection, the practice of using sterile techniques for surgeries was virtually unknown. In 1865, Dr. Joseph Lister, following Pasteur’s revelation, was the first surgeon to use a room sterilized with an antiseptic for his surgeries. The surgeon’s successful technique inspired Dr. Joseph Lawrence to develop a formula in 1879 for a liquid antiseptic that could be used to sterilize operating rooms and disinfect wounds. Lawrence sold his formula to Jordan Lambert, whose company was the first to market a diluted version of the formula as a mouthwash. However, it wasn’t until 1921, when Gerard Jordan decided to advertise the product as a remedy for bad breath, that sales really took off.

According to the passage, the first surgeon to operate in a room sterilized with antiseptic was

Each of the islands offers something special, and the most challenging part of trip planning may be narrowing down which islands to visit and which friendly wildlife to observe. Santa Cruz or San Cristobal Islands are popular stops for viewing prehistoric-looking giant tortoises and visiting research centers—esteemed for their conservation projects for terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The article recommended Wolf or Darwin Islands for adventure seekers with diving skills who want the opportunity to see whale sharks and hammerhead sharks in their native habitat. Fernandina, the most volcanically active as well as the youngest island, is said to be a popular spot for viewing iguanas, because the largest colony of marine iguanas is located there. And Española is the site of nesting albatrosses, the seabird with a huge wingspan of nearly eight feet. Any of these islands is surely a setting for a memorable vacation.

In this tradition, the anatomy of the brain includes three regions whose names respect the physicians who studied them. First, the circular network of arteries that supplies the brain with blood is known as the circle of Willis. This vascular ring was named after one of the earliest neuroscientists, Thomas Willis, who didn’t actually discover the ring but was the first to describe and illustrate it in detail in one of his medical books, Cerebri Anatome. A second region was named after the French neurosurgeon Pierre Paul Broca, who studied the effects of damage in this region on his patients. Broca’s area is located on one of the frontal lobes, and its function is critical to the production of speech. Closely related to Broca’s area is Wernicke’s area, named after the German physician Carl Wernicke. Located mostly in the temporal lobe but also partially in the parietal lobe, this region is involved in making sense of spoken words and using words appropriately.

According to the passage, the region studied by Willis is

I assigned my subjects to one of two groups based on whether they lived in my city or not. My subjects were all required to eat one meal of their choice at each of four specific national chain restaurants within the month of May. Local friends and family members each received my special treatment, four gift cards each worth $10 at the four restaurants. My distant friends and family members paid entirely out of their own pockets. My hypothesis was that the subjects who received gift cards would order, on average, more expensive meals than the subjects who did not receive gift cards for the same restaurant. I have collected my subjects’ records of their dining out expenses and can hardly wait to analyze the results. 

Based on the passage, which of the following is a correct statement about the study?

For example, ancient Native Americans left art on the rock walls at Upper Pictograph Cave. The figures painted onto the rock surface with an organic pigmented mixture resemble both animal and human forms, while other creations are more abstract. Starting in the early 1900s, miners of tungsten left visible marks behind in the way of structures, trash, pulleys, and mining shafts at the Johnson Lake Mine, which was abandoned in the 1930s after an avalanche. And Absalom Lehman, an early settler in the Snake Valley, made several contributions to other parts of the park, beginning with his rediscovery in the 1800s of the underground caves that now bear his name. He also planted an orchard in the 1930s, of which a few trees remain today, and built an aqueduct still discernible in some places.

The technique relies on familiarity with a route and the association of list items with landmarks along that route. After identifying the list you want to memorize, such as past presidents of the United States, select a familiar route to help memorize your list, such as the drive from your home to your place of work. Before developing associations, mentally rehearse the route several times to make it very clear. Depending on the length of your list, adjust the length of the route as necessary by adding or removing details of the journey. Next, associate items with landmarks along your route. For example, to associate the first item on the list with putting on your seatbelt, you could envision the portrait of George Washington in uniform wearing a bright blue sash across his chest. Associations can also be odd or unreal, like Abe Lincoln directing traffic at the intersection with his top hat. Finally, retrace the journey periodically to reinforce the associations and master your memorization goal.

Based on the passage, what should be done just after selecting a familiar route?

A.	Associate items on the list with landmarks.

She approached a stand offering bundles of fresh herbs and was drawn to the rosemary with its rich, piney fragrance. Justine returned home with six of the rosemary bundles in her suitcase and treated them like tender flowers, gently trimming their ends and placing them in vases around the house. Over the course of the week, the sprigs dropped their leaves and their fragrance faded, so Justine bought a rosemary-scented candle and a potted rosemary plant. She placed the plant on the balcony of her apartment and tended it dutifully for a time, loved it even. But as autumn ended, so did her enthusiasm for the plant and its fragrance. Soon, Justine found a new favorite scent: eucalyptus. It had an energizing smell, a bit like rosemary, but was stronger and more complex. Justine stored the rosemary candle in a box with a lavender one she had bought over the summer and headed out to find a eucalyptus-scented candle for the holidays.

In observing the activities and habits of mammals in their natural habitat, I have often relied on tracking in fresh snow. Strangely enough, tracks of ermines [short-tailed weasels] were seldom found, and the few that were seen came from beneath a log, bush or windfall and disappeared beneath similar cover, rarely extending 20 feet on the surface of the snow. The larger, long-tailed weasels often traveled for miles on the surface of the snow. Possibly the ermines were following the burrows of mice through the snow, or perhaps they kept beneath the surface from fear of owls. This suggests a reason why ermines are so seldom seen abroad. They may be following burrows and runways of mice and seldom come to the surface of the ground.

According to the passage, tracks of long-tailed weasels are

A.	often found beneath the snow.

No other country can boast of such vast and valuable mineral deposits. Yet our country is not half developed. Treasures lie undiscovered in our mountains and under our farms,—gems of “purest ray serene” and still more precious metals. Some will be accidentally brought to light; but the majority are so disguised that their real nature is not seen. How unpromising are the best ores of iron, zinc and silver and the rarest gems! Then, again, there is “mimicry” in the mineral kingdom; worthless stones are often good imitations of the valuable, and fortunes have been sunk in mining pyrites for gold, mica for silver and slate for coal. But if we wait for mineralogists to develop our mineral resources, we must wait a millennium, our country is so vast and scientific laborers so few.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	The country’s limited supply of mineralogists is impeding development.

The Sittidae are a well-defined family of little birds. When not occupied with domestic cares, they congregate in small flocks that run up and down the trunks and branches of trees in search of insects. The nuthatch most commonly seen in the hills is the white-tailed species (Sitta himalayensis). The general hue of this bird is slaty blue. The forehead and a broad line running down the sides of the head and neck are black. There is a good deal of white in the tail, which is short in this and in all species of nuthatch. The under-parts are of a chestnut hue. The Himalayan nuthatch is very partial to the red berries of Arisaema jacquemontii—a small plant of the family to which the arums and the “lords and ladies” belong. Half a dozen nuthatches attacking one of the red spikes of this plant present a pretty sight.

In New Hampshire in early days, a wheelwright was not a man who made wagon-wheels (as such he would have had scant occupation), but one who made spinning wheels. Often he carried them around the country on horseback selling them, thus adding another to the many interesting itineracies of colonial days. Spinning wheels would seem clumsy for horse-carriage, but they were not set up, and several could be compactly carried when taken apart; far more ticklish articles went on pack-horses,—large barrels, glazed window-sashes, etc. Nor would it seem very difficult for a man to carry spinning-wheels on horseback, when frequently a woman would jump on horseback in the early morning, and with a baby on one arm and a flax-wheel tied behind, would ride several miles to a neighbor’s to spend the day spinning in cheerful companionship.

When everything is ready for felling, the “fitter” goes ahead marking each tree to be felled and the direction in which it is to fall by cutting a notch on that side. Then come the sawyers in pairs. First they chop a deep gash on the side of the tree toward which it is to fall, and then from the opposite side begin cutting with a long, Tuttle-tooth, crosscut-saw. The saw is a long, flexible ribbon of steel, with handles so affixed to each end that they can be removed easily. The cut is made on the pulling stroke, and hence the kerf [slit] can be very narrow. As soon as the saw is well within the trunk, the sawyers drive iron wedges into the kerf behind it, partly to keep the weight of the trunk from binding the saw, and partly to direct its fall.

Based on the passage, what should be done just after chopping a deep gash in the tree?

In a lead pencil there are only three substances, graphite, clay, and wood, but a really good one must be manufactured with as much care as if it were made up of twenty. First of all, the graphite is ground and ground and ground, until, if you take a pinch of it between your thumb and finger, you can hardly feel that anything is there. It is now sifted through fine silk and mixed with water and finely powdered clay, and becomes a wet, inky mass. This clay comes from Austria and Bohemia and is particularly smooth and fine. The amount put in is carefully weighed. If you have a hard pencil, it was made by using considerable clay; if your pencil is soft, by using very little; and if it is very soft and black, it is possible that a little lampblack [soot] was added.

According to the passage, which of the following steps occurs last?

In Michigan there is a stratum of rock salt thirty to two hundred and fifty feet thick and some fifteen hundred to two thousand feet below the surface. To mine this would be a difficult and expensive undertaking, and a far better way has been discovered. First, a pipe is forced down through the surface dirt, the limestone, and the shale to the salt stratum. The drill works inside this pipe and bores a hole for a six-inch pipe directly into the salt. A three-inch pipe is let down inside of the six-inch pipe, and water is forced down through the smaller pipe. It dissolves the salt, becomes brine, and rises through the space between the two pipes. It is carried through troughs to some great tanks, and from these it flows into “grain-settlers"" then into the “grainers” proper, where the grains of salt settle.

I was a merchant at Springfield, and kept a large country store, embracing dry goods, groceries, hardware, books, medicines, bed-clothes, mattresses,—in fact, everything that country people needed. Lincoln came into the store with his saddle-bags on his arm, and said he wanted to buy the fixings for a single bed.

The dry kiln has been, and probably still is, one of the most troublesome factors arising from the development of the timber industry. In the earlier days, before power machinery for the working-up of timber products came into general use, dry kilns were unheard-of, air-drying or seasoning was then relied upon solely to furnish the craftsman with dry stock from which to manufacture his product. Even after machinery had made rapid and startling strides on its way to perfection, the dry kiln remained practically an unknown quantity, but gradually, as the industry developed and demand for dry material increased, the necessity for some more rapid and positive method of seasoning became apparent, and the subject of artificial drying began to receive the serious attention of the more progressive and energetic members of the craft.

The process is actually a thorough and well-vetted one, and although the details may vary somewhat by publisher, the general approach is the same. First, a team of language experts reads magazines, scripts, books, and electronic publications daily to watch for the usage of new words. Once a word has been identified as a potential addition, the experts create a citation file of the new word, including examples of the word in context and information about its source. The language team then periodically reviews groups of citations—several citations can be submitted for one word. If there are enough citations, and the team can present evidence of widespread use, they prioritize the word for inclusion. Prior to the publication of a new dictionary edition, the language experts develop the word entry information for the new addition, including its definition, pronunciation, part of speech, and usage.

My sudden appearance in the household had evidently caused Madam Izabel surprise; perhaps it annoyed her, as well. But she drew me to a seat beside her and plied me with questions which I was at a loss how to answer, in view of the supposedly private nature of my mission to Brazil. Inwardly I blamed Dom Miguel for not telling me how far his daughter and his guests were in his confidence; but before I blundered more than a few aimless sentences a light voice interrupted us and Francisco Paola leaned over Madam Izabel’s chair with a vapid compliment on the lady’s charms and personal appearance that was fairly impertinent in its flippancy.

Which of the following statements does the passage suggest?

A.	The narrator is being ungracious to Madam Izabel.
B.	The narrator is an uninvited guest at Madam Izabel’s home.
C.	The narrator is relieved that Franciso Paola distracted Madam Izabel.
D.	The narrator is in agreement with Francisco Paola’s remarks to Madam Izabel.

I moved here 15 years ago when I received my graduate degree. Shortly thereafter, I ran for the office of city controller and was re-elected twice. During my years of service, I have seen the ways in which this community has banded together during times of economic crisis, and I am inspired by the incredible resilience and resolve of our citizens. Our city’s financial health is of the utmost importance to me, and as your mayor, I will not stop until the unemployment rate is at least two percentage points lower than it is now. I will also devote myself to improving the city’s public transportation system. Additionally, I pledge to hold 10 open office hours every month to give residents the opportunity to speak with me directly about the community and any concerns or questions they may have about my policies. If elected, I pledge to work faithfully to serve and improve this already great city.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the candidate’s

A.	record of service.
B.	campaign promises.

To produce lactose-free milk, chemists introduce a small amount of lactase into the milk to react chemically with the lactose. The lactase breaks down the lactose molecules into smaller sugar molecules: glucose and galactose. These smaller, simple sugar molecules can be absorbed by the small intestine without undergoing further digestion and are then passed directly into the bloodstream. Therefore, the milk product resulting from this process allows lactose intolerant people to avoid discomfort after drinking this version of a favorite dairy beverage.

The major emphasis of the passage is on the

A.	role of lactase in the intestinal tract.
B.	reason for creating lactose-free milk.
C.	chemical process of producing lactose-free milk.
D.	identification of the sugars found in dairy products.

I know you are looking for a change of scenery, having lived in this state much of your life, but this move would be quite a drastic change. Establishing yourself in a new town—especially in a town that is completely unfamiliar to you—will be challenging, and it will be all the more difficult for you because you tend to be more of an introvert than an extrovert. I would be happy to come visit you, and I am sure you would make friends quickly through work, but it may get lonely during your first few months there. I want you to know I support you in all of your decisions, but I also want to make sure you thoroughly think this through before you pack your bags. So please, let me know if there is anything I can do to help or if you need someone to talk to as you consider your decision.

Whenever I’ve sat still for too long in my home office, there are several things I do to raise my energy level. I first consider going on a walk, even if it is only a short stroll around the block. Getting outside and moving my body usually boosts my mood and makes me feel more energized. I’ll also try listening to music while stretching. The music helps invigorate my mind and the stretching helps to revive my muscles. Another thing that works for me is to straighten up my work area. Clearing my desktop of unnecessary items and emptying my wastebasket makes me feel more relaxed. If taking a short break is not enough, I will leave the house to run a quick errand. This is the perfect way to knock an item off my to-do list while spending some time away from my desk.

In the year 1860, shortly before leaving England for a long continental tour, the late Mr. William Longman requested me to make for him some sketches of the great Alpine peaks. At this time I had only a literary acquaintance with mountaineering, and had even not seen—much less set foot upon—a mountain. Amongst the peaks which were upon my list was Mont Pelvoux, in Dauphiné. The sketches that were required of it were to celebrate the triumph of some Englishmen who intended to make its ascent. They came—they saw—but they did not conquer. By a mere chance I fell in with a very agreeable Frenchman who accompanied this party, and was pressed by him to return to the assault. In 1861 we did so, with my friend Macdonald—and we conquered. This was the origin of my scrambles amongst the Alps.

One was a magnificent bay, up to any weight; the other a sturdy brown. Sapt signed to me to mount the bay. Without a word to the man, we mounted and rode away.

The dwelling of my grandmother and grandfather had few pretensions. It was a log hut, or cabin, built of clay, wood, and straw. At a distance it resembled—though it was smaller, less commodious and less substantial—the cabins erected in the western states by the first settlers. To my child’s eye, however, it was a noble structure, admirably adapted to promote the comforts and conveniences of its inmates. A few rough, Virginia fence-rails, flung loosely over the rafters above, answered the triple purpose of floors, ceilings, and bedsteads. To be sure, this upper apartment was reached only by a ladder—but what in the world for climbing could be better than a ladder? To me, this ladder was really a high invention, and possessed a sort of charm as I played with delight upon the rounds of it.

A single farmhouse which I had not seen before is sometimes as good as the dominions of the King of Dahomey.

With what wind there was to fill her sails she stood close in to shore on the northeast side, where it fell calm and remained so all night.

I heard the sea booming against the cliffs all night, and realized that the ocean swell was still great, although from the deck of my little ship it was apparently small. From the cry of animals in the hills, which sounded fainter and fainter through the night, I judged that a light current was drifting the sloop from the land, though she seemed all night dangerously near the shore, for, the land being very high, appearances were deceptive.

He was a man of about forty-two years of age, of large build, but slightly round-shouldered. His massive head momentarily shook a shock of reddish hair, which resembled a lion’s mane. His face was short with a broad forehead, and furnished with a moustache as bristly as a cat’s, and little patches of yellowish whiskers upon full cheeks. Round, wildish eyes, slightly near-sighted, completed a physiognomy essentially feline. His nose was firmly shaped, his mouth particularly sweet in expression, high forehead … and furrowed with wrinkles like a newly-plowed field. The body was powerfully developed and firmly fixed upon long legs. Muscular arms, and a general air of decision gave him the appearance of a hardy, jolly, companion.

I caught a flat-car loaded with mixed lumber and crawled away into a comfortable nook. I lay on my back with a newspaper under my head for a pillow.

As soon as he ceased his tramp and the noise of his crunching, grinding footsteps died away, the silence, vast, illimitable, enfolded him like an immeasurable tide. From all that gigantic landscape, that colossal reach of baking sand, there arose not a single sound. Not a twig rattled, not an insect hummed, not a bird or beast invaded that huge solitude with call or cry. Everything as far as the eye could reach, to north, to south, to east, and west, lay inert, absolutely quiet and moveless under the remorseless scourge of the noon sun.

Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the birds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house, until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some traveler’s wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time.

Soon after receiving our certifications, we purchased some equipment, including masks, fins, snorkels, and dive computers. We were able to save a little money by borrowing weight belts and wetsuits from our friends who ran the local dive shop. We learned that renting the more expensive and bulky equipment, such as regulators and tanks, would be more cost-efficient for us, since we were weekend and holiday divers only.

Despite his samurai training, Matsuo Basho, born Matsuo Kinsaku, forsook his warrior status to study literature and eventually became one of the most famous Japanese poets of the seventeenth century. Basho started out writing poetry called haikai, a traditional poetic form with verses written cooperatively by different poets. The initial verse of the haikai, called the hokko, consisted of three lines of five, seven, and five syllables. Basho, along with other poets of his time, used the structure of the hokko to create short, independent poems, which became known as haiku.

Although the most German of rivers, the Rhine does not run its entire course through German territory, but takes its rise in Switzerland and finds the sea in Holland. For no less than 233 miles it flows through Swiss country, rising in the mountains of the canton of Grisons, and irrigates every canton of the Alpine republic save that of Geneva. Indeed, it waters over 14,000 square miles of Swiss territory in the flow of its two main branches, the Nearer Rhine and the Farther Rhine, which unite at Reichenau, near Coire. The Nearer Rhine issues at the height of over 7,000 feet from the glaciers of the Rheinwaldhorn group, and flows for some thirty-five miles, first in a north-easterly direction through the Rheinwald Valley, then northward through the Schams Valley, by way of the Via Mala gorge, and Tomleschg Valley, and so to Reichenau.

Lindley Murray and Goold Brown laid down cast-iron rules for punctuation, but most of them have been broken long since and thrown into the junk-heap of disuse. They were too rigid, too strict, went so much into minutiae, that they were more or less impractical to apply to ordinary composition. The manner of language, of style and of expression has considerably changed since then, … ambiguity of expression is avoided and the aim is toward terseness, brevity and clearness. Therefore, punctuation has been greatly simplified, to such an extent indeed, that it is now as much a matter of good taste and judgment as adherence to any fixed set of rules. Nevertheless there are laws governing it which cannot be abrogated, their principles must be rigidly and inviolably observed.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about Murray and Brown is correct?

A.	They created punctuation rules they knew would be modified over time.

The weather was lovely as we journeyed over the Kasvin plain to Tehran, towards the end of September. Autumn in the North of Persia is a gloriously fine season, almost spring-like in many ways, and, indeed, it is called there the ‘second spring.’ The landscape then, though nearly barren of verdure, has a beauty of its own in warm soft colors, and the atmospheric effects on the hills and distances, evening and morning, are of wonderfully delicate tones and tints. The prominent feature in the landscape near Tehran is the grand cone-shaped Mount Demavend, about forty miles to the northeast, which shoots up 19,400 feet above ocean-level, and overtops all the surrounding heights by 6,000 feet or more. It stood out bold, cold, and clear against the blue sky, and looked beautifully white with a fresh covering of new snow, and it was more than usually distinct, from being clear of the cloud-crown it usually wears.

In discussing the journey, the author’s primary focus is on the

A.	season.
B.	altitude.
C.	weather.
D.	landscape.

No ornament for the drawing-room or parlor can possibly be more beautiful than a well-stocked and tastefully-arranged aquarium; nor is there one likely to be productive of a greater amount of pleasure and amusement. And it is instructive as well as amusing, for by means of it the statements of writers relative to the habits of certain marine animals may be verified by personal observation, and even difficult problems in natural history satisfactorily solved. Aided by one of these “mimic oceans,” let the reader commence the practical study of marine zoology, and I have little fear of [the reader] ever becoming tired of it.

In discussing aquariums, the author’s primary focus is on

A.	where to locate them in a home.
B.	what can be learned from them.
C.	how to organize their contents.
D.	why they can inspire readers.

We have selected the present plant (Ranunculus bulbosus) as a good representative of the numerous species of plants familiarly termed buttercups, partly because it is the most striking in effect, partly because it is the one that will most readily be met with under ordinary circumstances; for while its fine flowers and beautifully-cut leaves render it singularly well suited to the purposes of ornament, the abundance of it in every meadow throughout the country places it within the reach of all who would desire to adapt it to any artistic purpose. From the commonness of the plant, and its general distribution throughout England, it has received many other names: goldknob, goldcup, baffiner, troil-flower, polt, kingcup, buttercup, butter-flower, cuckoo-bud, are all synonyms.

In discussing buttercups, the author’s primary focus is on the plant’s

A.	features.
B.	availability.

As a matter of fact, there were enacted west of the Alleghenies, during that great struggle, deeds which proved of immense importance to the welfare of the United States. Had it not been for the capture from the British of the country northwest of the Ohio River by the gallant Virginia colonel, George Rogers Clark, it is fair to assume that the Old Northwest, as it came to be called, the present States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, would today be a part of the Dominion of Canada.

Naturally it is impossible within the limits of a small and unpretentious monograph to give an adequate idea of the range and variety of the labors that occupied Sir Joshua Reynolds for half a century or more, and no attempt will be made in this place to do more than indicate the forces that seem to have directed his brush, the masters whose labor inspired it. It has been pointed out in these pages that Reynolds was a great assimilator. He took from everybody, but he was always judicious, because, quite apart from his executive faculties, he had a critical gift of the first order. One has but to turn to his diaries to realize that his instinct was singularly sound. He could stand before an admitted masterpiece and enjoy all its beauties, without losing sight of any defect however small, and because his mind was beautifully balanced, the small points of objection did not spoil his appreciation of the whole work.

The [State] Department has varied in its scope somewhat from time to time, now enlarging its domain as the country grew, and greater needs developed, and now surrendering some of its functions to other departments, mainly the Department of the Interior. It was first known before the outbreak of the Revolution as the “Committee of Secret Correspondence,” with Benjamin Franklin at its head. Next it was known (1777) as the “Committee for Foreign Affairs,” and its first Secretary, Thomas Paine, was dismissed for making an official matter public. Next (1789) it was known as the Department for Foreign Affairs, and finally as the Department of State, with Thomas Jefferson as the Secretary. The Patent Office originated under this Department, but in 1849, when the Department of the Interior was organized, it was formally transferred to that department.

With the technological advances in the film industry, Kieran is discovering these types of films are becoming increasingly more thrilling. For example, in one film about the migration of African elephants, Kieran learned that the stunning underwater views of the elephants swimming were possible thanks to high-definition cameras with waterproof housings. Furthermore, a new film about a rare type of hummingbird relied on cameras with ultra-high-speed frame rates, which allowed the filmmakers to capture the activity of the bird’s extremely fast moving wings. Kieran was most impressed, however, with a documentary that included aerial footage and close-up images from camera-carrying drones that filmed lions and polar bears. Of the many documentaries she’s seen, Kieran’s all-time favorite presents the lifecycle of plants using time-lapse photography to condense weeks of plant growth into a few seconds of footage.

They are easily identified by their hinged, domed shells, which can be closed completely when a predator is near. Thanks to a low metabolic rate, the box turtle can survive when food is in short supply. Other facts about these turtles are that they grow to about four to eight inches in length, take about five to ten years to reach full maturity, and typically live for 50 years. Active when the weather is very warm, a box turtle will dig a hole up to two feet deep and hibernate when external temperatures become too cold.

I learned that cashews grow on trees throughout the tropics and are attached to the base of a cashew apple. The cashew apple, though edible, is not really a fruit. It is the swollen stem to which the cashew nut is attached. Surprisingly, the cashew nut itself is encased in a shell that contains an irritant similar to the irritant in poison ivy. For this reason, prior to harvesting the cashew nut, processors must remove the cashew from its shell, taking care not to come into contact with the shell’s caustic liquid. One way to accomplish this is to freeze the unshelled nuts, which will solidify the oily liquid and make the nuts easier to handle during shelling. The chemical irritants are not present in the cashew nut itself, and roasting or steaming the nuts will destroy any remaining oil from the shell. Now I appreciate this delicacy even more.

According to the passage, which of the following statements is true of a cashew shell?

A.	It contains a poisonous oil.
B.	It surrounds the cashew apple.
C.	It can be frozen to prolong flavor.

Orchard, meadow, wheat and cornfields stretched away on either hand, shut in by dense forests and wooded hills; beyond and above which, toward the right, towered the giant Alleghenies; their summits, still white from the storms of the past winter, lying like a bank of snowy clouds against the eastern horizon.

One beautiful summer’s afternoon, when we were about one year old, we had been taken on to the veranda to enjoy our afternoon nap, in order that we might have advantage of the delightful breeze that blew across the woods from the sea. As usual our uncle was nearby, and so soothing was the air that, unable to resist its drowsy influence, he, too, soon dozed off. Unfortunately we awakened before our unconscious nurse, and immediately rolled out of our cradles, and crawled along the pavement of the veranda. Great sport we had, I have no doubt, as children will, and certain it is that, attracted by their brilliant colors, we lost no time in removing from each other's heads our distinguishing ribbons, and speedily mixing them up.  

Which of the following statements about the children does the passage suggest?

A.	They were restless sleepers.
B.	They grew up in the tropics.
C.	They were raised by their uncle. 
D.	They looked alike to their uncle.

This prevents me from forgetting anything important, and it helps me next prioritize each task. I also color-code my tasks by project so I can manage resources—my time, materials, support staff—more accurately. In addition to using lists, I set daily reminders that alert me to upcoming meetings or deadlines. Finally, I plan short-term rewards, such as going outside for a quick walk after accomplishing a critical item on my list, to help keep me focused and motivated. I feel certain that these practices significantly increase my productivity and efficiency at work.

The major emphasis of the passage is on how to stay

A.	organized.

We could take turns driving on alternate weeks, and I would be happy to start us off by driving the first week. Not only would carpooling save money on fuel costs, it would also reduce the wear and tear on our vehicles. Furthermore, we will each be eligible for the prime parking spots that our neighboring companies reserve for carpoolers. Besides, carpooling would give us a convenient opportunity to get to know one another better. If you are interested, which I hope you are, please give me a call so we can work out the details.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

Do not tell anybody, least of all yourself, that you love the out-of-doors, unless you have your own path to the woods, your own cross-cut to the pond, your own particular huckleberry-patch and fishing-holes and friendships in the fields. The winds, the rain, the stars, the green grass, even the birds and a multitude of other wild folk try to meet you more than halfway, try to seek you out even in the heart of the great city; but the great out-of-doors you must seek, for it is not in books, nor in houses, nor in cities. It is out at the end of the car-line or just beyond the backyard fence, maybe—far enough away, anyhow, to make it necessary for you to put on your tramping shoes and with your good stout stick go forth.

Nestled among the trees and within walking distance of a creek that flows all year, the small cabin provides the family with a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city and from the extreme heat of the summer months. It has electricity and indoor plumbing, but there is no television reception or internet service. We wash all dishes by hand, and a wood-burning stove is the only source of heat. A wide front porch offers plenty of opportunities to sit and watch hummingbirds, squirrels, blue jays, and the occasional deer. Family members typically spend their days hiking or fishing and their evenings reading, playing board games, and listening to music.

Clouds curled across the sky, weaving through the moon and stars while the village, bathed in celestial light, rested below. She stepped closer, letting the dancing colors resolve themselves into scintillating points of light and dark, then stepped back again for the sheer joy of seeing the image emerge from the chaos. Reproductions she had seen paled in comparison to the magnificent, original work of art in front of her. Before she knew it, an hour had passed and the museum guard was respectfully tapping her shoulder, letting her know it was closing time.

While waiting for the train, she spied two jugglers several feet apart tossing oranges and apples to each other. Then, at the first stop, she saw a man and a woman dressed in identical outfits, from their fuzzy purple hats down to their tall black boots. She wondered what special event they were attending.

At the second-to-last stop, Aisha spotted a new flower vendor, handing out single carnations to interested passersby. Finally, just as the train pulled into Aisha’s station, she counted eight children practicing an intricate line dance.

Fortunately, her company’s annual fall conference was held in Maine that year to take advantage of the state’s vibrant fall foliage. Then, she was the winning bidder at a charity auction for a cruise to Alaska the next summer. Over the next few years, she saved up enough money to buy a plane ticket to Miami, Florida, to celebrate her twenty-ninth birthday. After that, with just 11 months to go and no vacation time left, Destiny was getting a little worried that she would miss her goal. But to her amazement, her boss announced the company was opening a new office in Arizona and asked her to go there to set up the computer network. Naturally, she jumped at the chance.

This had to be truly original to make a splash at the upcoming awards show. To start, he penciled in the skirt, a dramatic, flowing black silk fabric with an asymmetric hem. Next came the fitted bodice in black velvet, to which he added three-quarter-length bell sleeves trimmed with black satin. Glancing up and back again, he sketched in a line to represent black satin piping around the waist where the skirt attached to the bodice. As a finishing touch, he encircled the neckline with marks to indicate elegant embroidery featuring tiny silver leaves. He knew there would be modifications to this design but was very happy with his first draft.

Today she was going to the salon of Monsieur Charles Frederick Worth to be fitted for the gown she would wear for the big event, her wedding in the summer of 1874. Her mother was ecstatic that Monsieur Worth had agreed to design the gown, and her father was concerned that he might have to sell two or three of his horses to pay for it. Even though Monsieur Worth was born in England in 1825, he had been living in Paris so long that people forgot he wasn’t French. And, of course, no one could forget that even the Empress Eugénie and the actress Sarah Bernhardt bought several gowns each year from the House of Worth. Emilie had romantic visions of herself on her wedding day, clad in a delicious confection of silk, lace, and embroidered satin.

If there is a good beat, you will want to dance. You may not have the desire or know-how to do the foxtrot, or the tango, or the samba, but you will want to move. You may be able to limit your movement to a toe tap or a head bob, but the beat is a powerful thing. No need to avoid it, even if you could. More than likely, as soon as you start to tap your foot, you’ll notice that the people around you are tapping theirs too.

The yield of fruit was 43.6 percent greater in 1909 than in 1899. This high percentage of increase has been brought about in several ways. The recent development of rapid transportation, refrigerator service and of marketing facilities has greatly stimulated the culture of this as of all other fruits in the United States. An increased demand for canned and preserved cherries has sprung up so that cherries are much more used now than formerly, the trade in preserved cherries for confections and various drinks in particular having greatly increased. Lastly, better care of orchards and better means of combating insects and fungi have increased the yields during the last decade.

In the passage, the author’s purpose is most likely to

A.	defend the use of preserved cherries.
B.	compare cherry yields from two years.
C.	explain a large increase in cherry yields.
D.	promote better methods of growing cherries.

To the seller’s knowledge, the kitchen had not been renovated since the house was built in the early 1950s. After a few months of work, the kitchen was complete, and he moved on to the bathroom, which needed new fixtures and tile work. Once the bathroom updates were complete, Montel took a break from home repairs to rebuild his savings so he could afford to fix up the bedroom. He was able to save a considerable amount of money by completing most of the work on the bedroom himself, including refinishing the existing hardwood floor.

We decided we wanted to design and build our own furniture, and maybe, if we were any good at it, we could start our own furniture business. We signed up for a 12-month intensive program and began our first class shortly thereafter. Although the instructors were knowledgeable and introduced us to many different techniques, I discovered that, unlike my friends, I did not have a passion for the craft. Although I eventually attained a reasonable level of proficiency in woodworking, I found that I did not enjoy working with wood. Thankfully, though, during the ninth month, I wandered into the metalworking class next door. From that moment on, I was hooked on this new craft, and I immediately switched classes. It has been decades since I first picked up a welding torch, and while metalworking certainly isn’t for everyone, I am grateful to have made it my life’s work.

She questioned him immensely about England, about the British constitution, the English character, the state of politics, the manners and customs of the royal family, the peculiarities of the aristocracy, the way of living and thinking of his neighbors; and in begging to be enlightened on these points she usually enquired whether they corresponded with the descriptions in the books.

Even the short distances of vision, which until then had endured, succumbed before we had scrambled up the hill. We made a careful reconnaissance with hands and feet and found that the mountain path at the top branched in several directions. The town might lie in any direction. For more meditative cogitation Hori carefully lowered the bicycle to its side but unfortunately there was no ground beneath and off it slid. We heard it painfully scraping down the rocks.

The word “post” descends to us from the Roman posita (positus = placed), and is a link between our posts of today and the cursus publicus of the time of Augustus. In those days of arms the roads were laid for armies to traverse, not for traffic, and the organization of the posita was military. Stations were established at intervals on the chief routes, where couriers and magistrates could be furnished with changes of horses (mutationes). For the benefit of the travelers mansions or night quarters were erected. These State posts were only for the use of the Government, and they were ridden by couriers who had, besides their own mount, a spare horse for carrying the letters. Individuals were at times permitted to use the posts, for which privilege they had to have the permits or diplomata of the Emperor.

What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect, living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man’s ingenuity has proved equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the insect lived on a tree near the center of the oval. If the trees were approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the shape of our stellar universe.

She looked once at the shed of the platform opposite, then she shut her eyes and counted mentally how many posts supported it, how many scallops edged the roofing, how advertisements were hung within against the wall behind, and what they were all about. It was good practice. Anything could be used. The great idea, of course, was accuracy, and the power of noticing every detail in the quickest time. Pamela loved doing it, and she did not know yet, of course, that she had a special gift that way.

Horatio Markham bowed, and they entered the cottage. This building was, in its construction and appearance, almost indescribable. There was no semblance of arrangement or regularity about it. It was very large, and at the same time thoroughly inconvenient. … There was a room called the library; but which that room was, a stranger would have been puzzled to guess; for not a single apartment through the whole house was free from books, and in no one room were the books arranged in any order. There were books upon the tables, and books upon the chairs, and books on the floors. The very staircases were not free from them; and whenever a visitor came to the cottage to spend a day or two, it was an essential part of the preparation to remove the books from the bed on which they were lying.

The author describes the cottage’s library largely in terms of its

The whole range of chemical science contains no experiment of greater inherent interest than the development of a photographic plate. Let but the smallest ray of light fall upon its strangely sensitive surface, and some subtle invisible change takes place. It is then merely necessary to plunge the plate into a properly prepared chemical bath, and the gradual process of developing the picture begins. Slowly, very slowly, the colorless surface darkens wherever light has touched it. Let us imagine that the exposure has been made with an ordinary lens and camera, and that it is a landscape seeming to grow beneath the experimenter’s eyes. At first only the most conspicuous objects make their appearance. But gradually the process extends, until finally every tiny detail is reproduced with marvelous fidelity to the original.

As the eagle stirs up her nest upon the crags and forces her young over the confines of the inadequate abode, it is then that they spread their wings and soar away to freedom and independence. So is it with the great river of rivers, the St. Lawrence. Born among the Northwest Lakes, and sheltered there for a time, resenting intrusion, it steals away unnoticed from the watershed expanse.

Far off the smudge of smoke marked the track of a liner standing out, and two fishing boats, red-sailed, were creeping into harbor.

When she arrives in the morning, Amadi always pauses for a few minutes to view the inhabitants of the massive saltwater aquarium that graces the lobby. From there, she typically bypasses the elevator and ascends the main staircase to her office on the second floor, but often she continues up to the rooftop terrace for a bird’s-eye view of the cityscape before turning her attention toward work. At lunchtime, she enjoys eating in the large break room with its comfortable furniture and table tennis equipment for impromptu matches. Her favorite feature of the building, however, is the pneumatic tube system that uses compressed air to propel capsules through tubes that snake across the ceilings and down the walls. This relic of the past is still functional and comes in handy for transporting interoffice mail and small packages.

In 1938, Turing began working for Britain’s code-breaking organization in a division known as Hut 8. The Hut 8 team was tasked with deciphering the German navy’s coded messages. The Germans used a device known as the Enigma machine to encipher and decipher their messages. Because the machine’s rotors allowed for a vast number of settings, which were changed frequently, the code seemed impossible to break. That is, until Turing along with his colleague Gordon Welchman designed a deciphering machine known as the Bombe in 1939. In addition, in 1941, Turing developed a highly complex statistical technique—he named it Banburismus—that reduced the number of rotor position possibilities to help the Bombe more quickly decipher Enigma-encrypted communications. It is estimated that Hut 8’s code-breaking work, led by Turing, was instrumental in shortening the war by several years and saving millions of lives.

According to the passage, what was the name of the deciphering machine Turing helped invent?

A.	Hut 8

As an adolescent, I wrote romances, full of smart heroines and dashing heroes that were based on fairy tales with a modern twist. In my twenties, I began writing short biographies. I was fascinated by the life stories of all sorts of people—from Genghis Khan to Rosa Parks. Soon after I moved to Philadelphia, I switched to historical fiction, using my well-honed research skills and placing my characters into believable situations that I thought would appeal to a wide audience. Then one day, when the plot for a different kind of novel popped into my head, I decided to switch genres. For the last decade, I have been writing courtroom dramas, often drawing on details from interesting real-life cases, each brilliantly solved by an idealistic defense attorney.

During the drive, he kept thinking about the eyewitnesses he had interviewed the night before. Their statements contradicted each other—people’s memories were subjective, after all—but the witnesses in this case didn’t appear to have been in the same place at the same time, despite their testimonies to the contrary.

However, over the years, I have discovered that there are also a few downsides to being self-employed. One that has remained a struggle for me is the unpredictability of my workload. It seems as though I have either no work at all or more work than I can possibly accomplish by the deadlines. During my brief experience as an employee, I rarely experienced a problem with my workload. Perhaps that was because I had a great supervisor who monitored my projects and was willing to delegate tasks to other employees when I had too much work to handle by myself. However, as someone who is self-employed without employees, delegation isn’t possible, so it’s up to me to get the job done.

Following a few guidelines, which vary depending on the medium of the original document, is the key to success. For example, paper items such as deeds and letters should be stored at a low temperature, well below 75°F. Storing these items in a cool space, usually for minimal if any cost, will preserve them by slowing the rate of chemical decay and reducing insect activity. Also, to inhibit mold growth and insect activity, humidity in the space should not exceed 65% and not be lower than 15%. Excessive dryness could cause papers to become brittle and subject to damage. For storage of photographic media, such as acetate negatives or slides, cold storage is one approach to help limit fading of the images. For this approach, there are specific steps to follow, such as using vapor proof double bags to secure items in an upright freezer and monitoring freezer conditions. Storing family treasures with care is well worth the effort to ensure they survive intact.

Which of the following statements about preserving family documents is correct?

A.	Storing at high humidity limits the chemical decay of paper items.

Even in the time of Columbus, the ships could scarcely make headway against the wind and were more or less at the mercy of every passing breeze. But once sailors discovered the secret of sailing to windward, the advance and improvement of ships and rigging was very rapid. The great, cumbersome, square sails of the earlier ships were divided into many pieces so as to be more readily handled and trimmed; triangular sails took the place of the picturesque spritsails on the vessels’ bows. Hulls were built lower and deeper; and while the number of masts varied, they were reduced until two- and three-masted, square-rigged vessels, known as brigs and ships, were the standard types of ocean-going craft.

According to the passage, which of the following occurred as ocean-going ships advanced in design?

If anybody looks at a picture by Claude Monet from the point of view of a Raphael, they will see nothing but a meaningless jargon of wild paint-strokes. And if anybody looks at a Raphael from the point of view of a Claude Monet, they will, no doubt, only see hard, tinny figures in a setting devoid of any of the lovely atmosphere that always envelops form seen in nature. So wide apart are some of the points of view in painting. In the treatment of form, these differences in point of view make for enormous variety in the work. So that no apology need be made for the large amount of space occupied in the following pages by what is usually dismissed as mere theory; but what is in reality the first essential of any good practice in drawing.

To walk across country without much regard to roads was not new to Tess, and she showed her old agility in the performance. The intercepting city, ancient Melchester, they were obliged to pass through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a large river that obstructed them. It was about midnight when they went along the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps, keeping off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps. The graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand, but it was lost upon them now. Once out of the town they followed the turnpike-road, which after a few miles plunged across an open plain.

Based on the passage, the travelers’ motivation for walking during the night is most likely to

A.	escape the heat.
B.	avoid detection.
C.	see the cathedral by lamplight.
D.	cross the bridge without a crowd.

Although a few passersby had gathered to listen, the band was clearly there to practice rather than to perform. Curious, Mitchel approached the saxophonist and asked her why they were practicing outdoors rather than inside. The saxophonist explained that they liked getting out in the sunshine and fresh air. The trumpeter added that, although the acoustics were better indoors, by practicing outside they could meet people and advertise their next performance. The drummer chimed in that he enjoys playing in the park because the view is so pleasant, and the vocalist mentioned he appreciates the accompaniment of the wind through the trees and the chirping birds. Mitchel was so impressed with the band that he promised to attend their next performance and bring some of his friends along.

According to the passage, which band member stated that the acoustics were better indoors?

It holds more than 20 percent of the earth’s unfrozen fresh water, and its floor is approximately 3,900 feet below sea level. Situated on an active continental rift zone, where tectonic plates are moving apart from each other nearly one inch per year, the lake may become even larger in the future. Beyond its huge size, at an estimated age of about 25 million years, Lake Baikal is also the world’s oldest freshwater lake. Furthermore, this remarkable body of water is home to the Baikal seal, which is the only known seal that lives solely in a freshwater habitat. Despite its remote location, these record-breaking statistics make Lake Baikal a worthwhile destination.

According to the passage, one record-breaking fact about Lake Baikal is that it is

Measuring over 4,000 square miles, the salt flat, named Salar de Uyuni, is regularly mined for salt by the nearby residents. In addition to the salt flat, the plateau is home to both freshwater and saltwater lakes. The lakes have no drainage outlets, due to the surrounding mountains. In fact, Salar de Uyuni was formed thousands of years ago when a vast, prehistoric saltwater lake dried up under the hot sun, leaving its rich salt deposits behind as the water evaporated. During the rainy season between the months of February and April, the flats are covered in a few inches of water, and the reflection of the water mirrors the sky above, often leaving visitors wondering where the sky ends and the land begins.

Which of the following statements best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	The world’s largest salt flat continues to be mined for its salt.
B.	Salar de Uyuni was created by the unique conditions of the Altiplano.
C.	Visitors to the high plateau of Bolivia can enjoy fresh and saltwater lakes.

However, all of us kids loved nothing better than to be involved in some sort of team sport. When all four of us got together, our favorite sport was doubles tennis. However, we spent a lot of time playing other sports, too, and we didn’t always agree on which sport to play. In those cases, my sister and I usually gravitated toward one-on-one basketball, while our brothers happily headed off to play soccer instead. We all took swimming lessons at the community pool during the summer and played on different indoor hockey teams during the winter. But if we were all together, no matter what the season, we would invariably head to the tennis courts for a doubles match. Even now, as grown adults with children of our own, we bring our rackets to family gatherings in hopes of squeezing in a few sets.

The most challenging aspect of equine medicine, in Ned’s opinion, was not managing his own business, doing physically demanding tasks, or even being on call for emergencies. Rather, the biggest hurdle Ned faced was communicating with the owners of his patients. Sharing highly scientific information with owners was, at times, difficult. Ned had to learn how to simplify the complex language of his profession so that the owners could fully understand whatever physical ailments their horses were enduring. Experience had taught him a lot, but even after 20 years as a practicing veterinarian, Ned still struggled with communication from time to time.

According to the passage, the most difficult part of his profession for Ned was

A.	being on call for emergencies.
B.	running the veterinary business.

Here are no “Bellevues” or “Ben Lomonds” to set the neighborhood off upon the follies of competitive nomenclature; and although at the back of each house a large oblong garden contains a much better selection of trees and flowering shrubs than the average suburban garden, not even the mild pretentiousness of an appropriate arboreal name is tolerated.

However, this muscle plays a key role in exercises such as chin-ups and pull-ups and in activities such as swimming, rowing, and chopping wood. Running diagonally across the back and armpits and connecting to the underside of the upper arm, the lat muscle functions to help with certain movements involving the shoulder. For example, when one performs jumping jacks, the latissimus dorsi helps with the adduction of the arm, or the movement of the arm toward the trunk of the body, and facilitates the rotation of the arm at the shoulder. For optimal health and strength, it is beneficial to exercise this important back muscle regularly.

The author of the passage is most likely trying to

A.	compare activities.
B.	express an opinion.
C.	provide an explanation.

It is important that staff work their assigned shifts because the schedule intentionally pairs sales associates with staff who have keys to the store to ensure the proper closing and opening procedures are followed. In recent months, we have had sales associates covering shifts that were originally assigned to key holders, resulting in unnecessary delays in opening or closing the store.

I focused on the positive aspects of the new season by thinking about the long cozy evenings and days spent snowshoeing in the park. I repeated these things to myself over and over, but the brutal temperatures of December, January, and February made this year’s winter season feel like one of the longest. Only when the end of March finally came and I went an entire day without turning the heat on in my apartment did I smile with relief, because I knew that spring was just around the corner.

A.	The winter season seemed to last forever.
B.	The short days of winter have numerous benefits.
C.	The much-anticipated spring season is a fleeting one.
D.	The first hard frost of winter signals the end of the fall season.

My friend recommended crocheting as a relaxation exercise, but I’m hooked primarily because it is such a productive hobby. While crocheting is a form of artistic expression for many people, I enjoy it because I can transform yarn into so many useful items. So far, I’ve made hats, socks, blankets, and even bathmats. While crocheting allows me to hone my hand-eye coordination and serves as a way to increase the dexterity in my hands, the many different kinds of gifts I can make out of a ball of yarn is what brings me back to this craft again and again.

According to the passage, the author continues crocheting primarily because it

A.	increases hand dexterity.

Plaistow Manor-House or Hall was a fine brick mansion, built in the latter days of Tudor house architecture, with many gables and countless high chimneys—very picturesque to the eye, but not in all respects comfortable as are the modern houses of the well-to-do squirearchy [gentry] of England. And, indeed, it was subject to certain objectionable characteristics which in some degree justified the scorn which Mr. Amedroz intended to throw upon it when he declared it to be a farmhouse. The gardens belonging to it were large and excellent; but they did not surround it, and allowed the farm appurtenances to come close up to it on two sides. The door which should have been the front door, opening from the largest room in the house, which had been the hall and which was now the kitchen, led directly into the farmyard.

According to the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	The mansion was owned by nobles.
B.	The mansion is not liked by everyone.
C.	The mansion’s entrance was missing its door.
D.	The mansion conformed to the latest architectural style.

She started out by recycling and repurposing cast-off furniture as an affordable way to furnish her own home. Then, when her friends and family commented on the high quality of her pieces, she decided to turn her hobby into a business. Within a few months, she had refurbished and sold everything from dining sets to lamps to headboards. Soon, she reached out to a local interior designer, who agreed to add her to his list of furniture suppliers. When called upon, Laurel would work directly with the designer to create custom pieces for his clients. Her big breakthrough came when the designer was awarded a contract for redecorating the city’s art museum and put Laurel in charge of seating. This commission was profitable enough that, within six months, she was able to open a modest retail shop.

First, she got out the hose, a bucket, and a few rags and washed the exterior of her car. Then, she buffed the outside of the car with a polishing cloth until it gleamed. When the exterior was finished, Maxine moved on to the interior of the car. She began by cleaning all the glass and then wiping down the dashboard and center console. Next, she removed and vacuumed the floor mats. She then vacuumed the rest of the carpeting, returned the floor mats, and, as a final touch, made her own air freshener. She did this by putting a few drops of essential oil on a small piece of felt and hanging it from her rear view mirror.

Weatherworn and overgrown by lichen, it is not possible at the present day to see clearly the nature of the stones which go to make up Stonehenge. …Careful investigation reveals the fact that the stones vary very much in material, and that, further, just as the stones are placed in systematic order, so, too, has the same care been exercised in the selection of the material from which each circle or horseshoe has been built. Moreover, just as the stones can be divided into groups of uprights and imposts, or “Trilithons,” and “simple uprights,” so, too, has it been found that while all the Trilithons are composed of a “local” stone, known generally as “Sarsen,” all the “simple uprights” are of “foreign” stone, sometimes classed together roughly as “Syenite.”

She was so absorbed in the business in hand, that she did not feel the weariness of the task before her. Copying catalogues and tables could not be said to be an interesting task; but Caroline Herschel never weighed in the balance the nature of her work, whether it was pleasant or the reverse. It was her work, and she must do it; and it was service for one she loved best in the world, and therefore no thought of her own likes or dislikes was allowed to enter into the matter.

A house sitter was coming tomorrow morning, and I needed to give him a key to the front door to use during my two-week absence. I spent an hour methodically searching my usual hiding places, beginning with the bedroom dresser drawer where I kept my spare car key and ending with the kitchen canister of odds and ends. Recalling what I’d been doing yesterday, I checked the counter by the laundry machine and the coffee table in the den where I was watching television, but found no sign of the spare key. Deciding it was easiest to make a new key, I took a quick trip to the hardware store. Determined not to lose track of this new spare key, I placed it in an envelope and was about to tuck it into the inside pocket of the binder of instructions I’d made for my house sitter. And there in the pocket I found an envelope labeled “front door key.”

Led by theatrical director Hallie Flanagan, the Federal Theater Project brought forth a new and dynamic genre of theater, using factual information to create documentary-like productions that commented on the social issues of the day. This objective was best exemplified in the project’s Living Newspaper productions, which, unlike traditional plays that focused on one central character, consisted of a series of short scripted scenes with multiple actors who dramatized present-day events. Living Newspapers addressed a variety of controversial topics, including the consequences of the Agricultural Administration Act, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, and the power companies’ control of the nation’s electricity.

What does the #2 designation mean? It is actually a grade on a scale that indicates the hardness of the pencil’s core material—a graphite and clay blend. The higher the number, the higher proportion of clay in the mixture, and the higher the proportion of clay, the harder the core. A harder core produces a lighter pencil mark, whereas a softer core produces a darker pencil mark. Because scanning machines are configured to ignore light marks—to avoid capturing probable erasure attempts or unintentional marks—and marks made by softer pencils have a tendency to smudge, the #2 pencil is a good compromise and has become the industry standard.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Marks made by the highest numbered pencils resist smearing.

The oldest existing Dublin papers are Saunders’s (originally Esdaile’s) Newsletter, begun in 1744, and the Freeman’s Journal, instituted under the title of the Public Register, by Dr. Lucas in 1755. The Limerick Chronicle, the oldest Irish provincial newspaper, dates from 1768.

“Simplicity is the keynote of beauty”—no one article of clothing should stand out too conspicuously, unless it is the hat. Nature uses bright colors sparingly. If you look at a plant, you find it dark near the ground, growing lighter near the top with its green leaves, and then the blossom; the glory is at the top. Everything in nature teaches us to look up. So the hat should be the crowning glory of a costume, the center of interest, and should receive the most careful attention as to becomingness, suitability, and workmanship.

In the novel, the official language, called Newspeak, is designed by the government to restrict people’s freedom of expression and thought by reducing the meaning of words and limiting their number. For example, all synonyms and antonyms were eliminated, making the word ungood rather than bad the opposite of good. In this way, the government eliminated negative connotations of bad and emphasized positive associations with good. Conversely, Newspeak could shift public emotions in a negative direction by using uncold to mean hot, because cold tends to have negative connotations. By controlling the words used, the ruling party forced conformance to its way of thinking and made it difficult for people to develop an opposing viewpoint. Orwell’s novel remains an important work that demonstrates the power of language and how its unrestricted use is necessary for critical thinking, free will, and imagination.

In discussing 1984, the author’s primary focus is on how Orwell’s novel

A.	speaks out against totalitarian governments.

While each branch of the U.S. military has its own terminology, the Marine Corps is well known for its extensive use of jargon. Because the Marine Corps has close ties to the Navy, a lot of the terminology marines use is related to seafaring. Windows, for example, are called “portholes,” and doors are referred to as “hatches.” To a marine, walls are “bulkheads,” and floors are “decks.” Although slang terms tend to change quite quickly in the civilian world, the nautical terms adopted by the Marine Corps are steeped in naval tradition and remain relatively constant. Thus, a common language unites generations of marines.

Just about any method of public transportation—whether bus, trolley, light rail, subway, commuter train, or vanpool—helps improve the quality of life for everyone. Use of public transportation rather than privately owned vehicles saves fuel and reduces road congestion. Money invested in public transportation creates jobs, supports businesses, and can even lead to increased values of homes located where service is provided. The average household can potentially save thousands of dollars each year by downsizing to a single vehicle or giving up their cars entirely and switching to public transportation. Also, public transportation systems help create a sense of community and provide greater access to jobs, schools, friends, and recreational opportunities.

3479.	I am conflicted about having to travel so often for work. On the one hand, I like to spend more time at home; but on the other hand, I relish the opportunity to experience other cultures, try new foods, and, most importantly, network with clients outside of my region. On a recent trip to New Orleans, I met a new client who took me to a few jazz music hotspots. There, I learned that discussing music can be a great way to bond with a business associate. On another trip, I mistook green tea powder for the pungent condiment wasabi when meeting with a client at a Japanese café in San Francisco. However, my blunder served as an icebreaker, and we were able to laugh about it as we concluded our meeting the next day. I know that frequent business travel can be inconvenient at times, but the benefits are many.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	share a few stories about their own business trips.
B.	suggest how to be successful during business trips.
C.	persuade others to network through business travel.
D.	promote places for engaging in successful business travel.

Fifteen years ago, when she was a young child, she had spotted the small bronze camels on a bookshelf in her grandfather’s office, and it was at that time she and her grandfather had given them all names. Now, she glanced up at them fondly as her gaze went from the largest, named Cameron, to Camellia, then Camden, and finally, to the smallest one named Cammy. Last year, when her grandfather retired and was cleaning out his office, he gave the figurines to Lydia. Although the camels are now kept in a different place, they still remind Lydia of her grandfather and simpler times.

Although required to pass a driving test, drivers seem to have forgotten everything they ever learned about good driving practices. Even if they have trouble remembering a few simple rules, they should be able to figure them out, because good driving is mainly just a matter of common sense and common courtesy. The turn indicators signal which way a driver is going to turn, so simply turning that signal on before you make your move is about as fundamental as you can get. However, no aspect of driving irritates me more than people who improperly park their vehicles. For some reason, it has become increasingly difficult for drivers to turn their steering wheels properly and park their cars between two parallel lines.

Our party availed themselves of an upward-bound steamboat, and slowly ascended the Mississippi, whose turbid and swollen waters rolled far and wide beyond their usual boundaries. The river was filled with broken rafts, drift logs, and half-sunken and floating trees. The danger of running upon a snag, or encountering a sawyer, was great and impending. The current was so strong that their boat, although striving to keep in shore, would frequently be caught by a whirl or an eddy, and like a stray leaf upon a rivulet, would be turned round and round until striking against a tree, it would be sent into the mid current and again be carried for miles among the trees.

Nearly the whole period of their stay was embraced in one uninterrupted storm, but the magnificence of the scenery compensated for the inclemency of the weather. Vegetation was still in full luxuriance, and the moss, pendent from the trees, and saturated with incessant rain, like dripping garments swayed to and fro in the wind, while low, rugged clouds trailed along but a short distance overhead, and a gray semi-transparent mist floated above the surface of the ground. The “Mississippi,” unusually turbid, and swollen to the utmost capacity of its banks, with its mighty whirls and eddies, rushed impetuously on, bearing on its surface many a vestige of the devastation it had caused.

He forgot everything, dress, breakfast, his father, the time of day and the time of year, and when he rose from his seat he had written the first chapter of his novel. For some occult reason he had stopped suddenly and dropped his pen. He knew instinctively that he had reached his first halting-place, and he paused for breath, left the table and went to the window. To his astonishment the sun was already casting shadows in the little brick yard, and he knew that it must be past noon. He looked at himself and saw that he was not dressed, then he looked at his watch and found that it was one o’clock. He rubbed his eyes, for it had all been like a dream, like a vision of fairyland, like a night spent at the play.

The wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage. As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like cannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices. As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a few fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible.

He twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile—he was one of those saturnine people who smile with the corners of the mouth down,—and bowed his acknowledgment of my complaisance. The main entrance to the enclosure was passed; it was a heavy wooden gate, framed in iron and locked, with the cargo of the launch piled outside it, and at the corner we came to a small doorway I had not previously observed. The white-haired man produced a bundle of keys from the pocket of his greasy blue jacket, opened this door, and entered. His keys, and the elaborate locking-up of the place even while it was still under his eye, struck me as peculiar. I followed him, and found myself in a small apartment, plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with its inner door, which was slightly ajar, opening into a paved courtyard.

This tower, with the plaster clinging to its walls—how can we explain its survival when the rest of the once stately abbey has vanished? Probably the reason lies partly in its strength and partly in its plainness and the absence of wrought [shaped] stone tempting human greed. As has been well said, “it still stands a picturesque and sturdy relic of an age of good lime-burners and honest masons.” The wrought stone of one or two windows in the adjacent walls has been removed, but what indications remain suggest the close of the twelfth century as that virtuous age.

There was a silence, and Mrs. Douglas sat looking into the fire. She was far away from the little house among the hills. She was young again, and the husband of her youth was once more at her side. Pictures, softened and beautified by time, unrolled themselves before her eyes. Children played in a garden among flowers, their laughter and shouting came to her ears, she could see their faces lifted to hers; but no beckoning could bring them to her, for long ago they had grown up and gone away; they were but dream children who played in that garden.

Regina sat up, leaned towards the closed window and looked out. The glass reflected the interior of the compartment—the lamp, her own figure wrapped in a long, light-colored cloak, her face wan with weariness. She half-closed her large, short-sighted eyes, and in the misty moonlight, against the grey background caused by the reflection of her cloak, she made out the landscape—bluish undulations fleeting by, a mysterious pathway, a tree with silver leaves lashed by the wind, and in the distance a long line of aqueducts, the arches of which disappeared into the moonlight and seemed like a row of immense inhospitable doors.

The old fiddle squeaks and shrieks in protest, but Tamoszius has no mercy. The sweat starts out on his forehead, and he bends over like a cyclist on the last lap of a race. His body shakes and throbs like a runaway steam engine, and the ear cannot follow the flying showers of notes—there is a pale blue mist where you look to see his bowing arm. With a most wonderful rush he comes to the end of the tune, and flings up his hands and staggers back exhausted; and with a final shout of delight the dancers fly apart, reeling here and there, bringing up against the walls of the room.

It does not concern [those] who are asleep in their beds, but it is very important to the traveler, whether the moon shines brightly or is obscured. It is not easy to realize the serene joy of all the earth, when she commences to shine unobstructedly, unless you have often been abroad alone in moonlight nights. She seems to be waging continual war with the clouds in your behalf. Yet we fancy the clouds to be her foes also. She comes on magnifying her dangers by her light, revealing, displaying them in all their hugeness and blackness,—then suddenly casts them behind into the light concealed, and goes her way triumphant through a small space of clear sky.

Lest anyone who might borrow this book and read it should think that I am not so very good, and am putting my best foot foremost, let me hasten to say that if I told the whole truth it would be much more favorable to me than this poor expurgated version will make it seem. I have done many very good things which I shall not dare to set down in these pages, for if I should record them some envious and unkind readers might say that I did these things in order to write them in a book and get fame and credit for their doing, and so after all they were not really good.

A sudden chill enveloped us. Stars in a moment crowded through the dark heaven, flashing with a frosty splendor. The snow congealed, the brooks ceased to flow, and, under the powerful sudden leverage of frost, immense blocks were dislodged all along the mountain summits and came thundering down the slopes, booming upon the ice, dashing wildly upon rocks. Under the lee of our shelf we felt quite safe, but neither Cotter nor I could help being startled, and jumping just a little, as these missiles, weighing often many tons, struck the ledge over our heads and whizzed down the gorge, their stroke resounding fainter and fainter, until at last only a confused echo reached us.

But though it was July when this history begins, the flush of summer—and though the sunshine was sweet upon the trees and the water, and the bare old walls of the castle, there was little animation in Norlaw. The blinds were drawn up in the east room, the best apartment—though the sun streamed in at the end window, and “the Mistress” was not wont to leave her favorite carpet to the tender mercies of that bright intruder; and the blinds were down in the dining room, which nobody had entered this morning, and where even the Mistress’s chair and little table in the corner window could not keep a vicarious watch upon the kitchen door.

As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the bank opposite, just above the water’s edge, caught his eye, and dreamily he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would make for an animal with few wants and fond of a bijou riverside residence, above flood level and remote from noise and dust. As he gazed, something bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it, vanished, then twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could hardly be a star in such an unlikely situation; and it was too glittering and small for a glow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at him, and so declared itself to be an eye; and a small face began gradually to grow up round it, like a frame round a picture.

Wrapped in her plaid shawl, with a look of inspiration as she faced the breeze, the English woman gazed fixedly at the great sun ball as it descended toward the horizon. Far off in the distance a three-master in full sail was outlined on the blood-red sky and a steamship, somewhat nearer, passed along, leaving behind it a trail of smoke on the horizon. The red sun globe sank slowly lower and lower and presently touched the water just behind the motionless vessel, which, in its dazzling effulgence, looked as though framed in a flame of fire. We saw it plunge, grow smaller and disappear, swallowed up by the ocean.

We went all the way in day-coaches, becoming more sticky and grimy with each stage of the journey. Jake bought everything the newsboys offered him: candy, oranges, brass collar buttons, a watch-charm, and for me a ‘Life of Jesse James,’ which I remember as one of the most satisfactory books I have ever read. Beyond Chicago we were under the protection of a friendly passenger conductor, who knew all about the country to which we were going and gave us a great deal of advice in exchange for our confidence. He seemed to us an experienced and worldly man who had been almost everywhere; in his conversation he threw out lightly the names of distant states and cities. He wore the rings and pins and badges of different fraternal orders to which he belonged. Even his cuff-buttons were engraved with hieroglyphics, and he was more inscribed than an Egyptian obelisk.
