The base is located roughly 70 miles northeast of the city of London, and about 25 miles from Cambridge. First opened in 1941, the base was originally a satellite airfield for the RAF Mildenhall, which is situated approximately 7 miles away, but by the end of 1943, RAF Lakenheath was operating as an independent unit. For those working on base, the closest residential area is Lakenheath village, which is approximately 5 miles by car. RAF Lakenheath hosts thousands of active duty military members, and thanks to the base’s proximity to major cities in the United Kingdom, these service members and their families can explore all that the area has to offer.

According to the passage, approximately how many miles is RAF Lakenheath from RAF Mildenhall?

A.	70
B.	25

After working out cost estimates, she decided to build a workshop on a vacant portion of her property in order to eliminate her monthly rental payment. As she began thinking through her plans, she realized having her own workshop would yield additional benefits. For example, by avoiding the commute to and from the leased space, she could spend more time being productive. She would be able to install a built-in surveillance system for added security. She could also have a small seating area for meetings with clients, where some of her finished products—such as cabinets, tables, and chairs—could be displayed. Within six months, Hannah’s workshop was completed, and over time, it paid off as one of the best business investments she had ever made.

According to the passage, Hannah originally decided to build her own workshop in order to

A.	have room to display her finished products.
B.	eliminate her monthly rental payment.

From the cottage the ground descended in a slight slope, which terminated in a white sandy beach at the margin of the lake. Near the beach were fastened the small skiffs, which swayed to and fro amongst the rushes, where the children delighted to sail their miniature ships. From the rear of the house the little valley extended itself in undulating fields and meadows, interspersed with barren hillocks and thrifty potato patches. In the fields could be heard the tinkling of the cow-bells, the bleating of lambs, and the barking of a dog as he gathered together his little flock. Carlo was a fortunate dog, for the farm was so small that he could keep his entire charge within sight at all times.

According to the passage, where was the dog?

Rumi was looking over his credit card statement and noticed how much money he spent on candles, which he used to keep his apartment smelling fresh and to provide a warm and welcoming atmosphere. He thought he could save a little money each month by making candles instead of buying them. Also, candle making might be a fun activity to do with his friends, reusing the empty candle jars that were accumulating in his kitchen cupboards. Mainly, though, he wanted to make his own candles in order to create custom fragrances for his home. He preferred scents that combined floral and citrus notes, and he wanted to try mixing different scents together. In the end, Rumi’s new hobby became one of his favorite weekend activities.

Now, a novel, in our days, is a three-story affair—a complicated, complex, multiform composition, requiring no end of scenery and dramatis personæ, and plot and plan, together with trap-doors, pit-falls, wonderful escapes and thrilling dangers; and the scenes transport one all over the earth—to England, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, and Kamchatka. But this is a little commonplace history, all about one man and one woman, living straight along in one little prosaic town in New England. It is, moreover, a story with a moral; and for fear that you shouldn’t find out exactly what the moral is, we shall adopt the plan of the painter who wrote under his pictures, “This is a bear,” and “This is a turtle-dove.” We shall tell you in the proper time succinctly just what the moral is, and send you off edified as if you had been hearing a sermon.

We will now proceed to consider the acoustical properties of the violin. These are, in every particular, surprisingly great, and are the results of many tests, the chief of which has been the adoption of several varieties of wood in its construction. In Brescia, which was in all probability the cradle of violin manufacture, the selection of the material of the sides and back from the pear, lemon, and ash trees was very general, and there is every reason to believe that Brescia was the first place where such woods were used. It is possible that the makers who chose them for the sides and backs of their instruments considered it desirable to have material more akin to that adopted for the bellies, which was the finest description of pine, and that the result was found to be a tone of great mellowness. If they used these woods with this intention, their calculations were undoubtedly correct.

During the first few games, before he was fully warmed up, Graham tended to rely heavily on his strong forehand drive, so Ana would try to return short or backspin balls to force him to use his weaker strokes. As the game intensified, Graham would step up his performance by applying a topspin to the ball. However, Ana would consistently return Graham’s topspins with an aggressive forehand or backhand drive. Although Graham had a good forehand drive, his favorite stroke was the block, which came into play when Ana took advantage of a high bounce by executing a smash. Graham’s block allowed him to use the force of Ana’s smash against her by returning the ball just as fast. After about six months of competing against each other, the two opponents joined a table tennis club where they were exposed to many different styles of play.

Her latest work involved restoring a circa 1920s bank in the heart of the city’s historic district. While on site for a routine inspection, she was able to witness the opening of the bank’s vault, which had been locked for many years. Expecting the vault to be empty, the onlookers were surprised to discover a box had been left inside. The box contained a newspaper dated October 29, 1929, otherwise known as “Black Tuesday,” the day the stock market crashed and triggered the Great Depression. It’s quite possible, Sandy mused, that this was one of the many American banks that had failed due to the economic collapse that began on that fateful day.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

Soon, more and more stop signs appeared around the country. However, prior to today’s iconic red octagon with white lettering, stop signs existed in several color combinations, shapes, and sizes. In 1923, state representatives urged the country’s highway associations to standardize street signs to avoid confusion and to improve visibility, especially at night. By 1935, the earliest national standardization went into effect, dictating that all stop signs would have black lettering on a white background. It wasn’t until nearly two decades later, in 1954, after a durable red coating was produced, that the white-on-red octagon became the U.S. standard for stop signs.

According to the passage, in what year were the first U.S. national standards for stop signs implemented?

Chicle is a natural gum derived from the latex of the sapodilla tree, which is native to southern Mexico, northern Belize, and northeastern Guatemala. Soon, chicle chewing gum became so popular that the chicle suppliers, who had to wait about seven years between harvests before re-tapping their trees, had trouble keeping up with the demand. However, the popularity of chewing gum and thus the demand for chicle continued to surge, and by the 1920s, the average American chewed around 100 sticks of gum every year. With chicle in short supply, gum manufacturers turned to synthetic alternatives, and by 1980, the United States stopped importing chicle altogether.

According to the passage, the United States stopped importing chicle because

A.	other ingredients were more flavorful.
B.	it was too time consuming to harvest.
C.	artificial chewing gum was available.

The clear favorites with the crowds seemed to be the cars with fancy paint jobs and whitewall tires. Her father’s preference, on the other hand, was for the outdated design features from long ago, like the bench seat or the spare tire suspended on the side door of a vehicle rather than on the rear end. He also commented that he had never seen such a variety of figures atop car hoods before, and Marly admitted she was most intrigued by the amazing range of sizes, shapes, and quality of the hood ornaments. Her younger brother, fascinated by the protruding tail fins and lights, was amused to learn they were intended to mimic the appearance of rocket ships.

I had always loved the country, but my wife preferred the city. I could take no step but such as would be likely to promote her happiness. So long as times continued fair, we ceased to canvass the propriety of a removal. We had children to educate, and to her the city seemed the best and most convenient place for qualifying them for future usefulness. Then, most of our relations resided near us. Our habits were eminently social. We had made numerous friends, and among our neighbors there had turned up many valuable families. We felt even the thought of breaking away from all these cordial ties to be a trying one. But the refuge of a removal to the country had taken strong hold of my mind.

He could purchase a brand new dining room table, buy a used one at a thrift store, refurbish his current table himself, or just defer the decision altogether and put up with his table’s nicks and scratches. He had been looking at new tables for a while, and he was having trouble finding a replacement piece that was within his budget and had the charm and functionality of his current table. His dining table wasn’t a precious family heirloom, but it was one of the first pieces of furniture he had ever purchased for himself. Sure, his table was nearly 20 years old, but despite its appearance, it still served its purpose. Raul turned his back on the sleek new dining room table with the hefty price tag and headed straight for the hardware store.

A few months ago, she received a letter addressed to “Alluhson.” The most memorable spelling variation, in her opinion, appeared on a thank you message from a new friend that began with, “Dear Alycein.” Enjoying the fact that her name had so many spelling variations, Allison had recently started a list to keep track of them all.

She searched impatiently for the remote—she was exhausted and wanted to get back to bed—but couldn’t find it. Her dog was resting on the couch and in that moment he moved, revealing the remote control wedged between him and the seat cushions. It wasn’t until Trinity had laid her head back on her pillow that a smile played across her face at the thought of her dog watching the shopping channel.

Although it would be a short trip -- just four days long including the weekend -- she planned to make the most of it. Vanessa was a big fan of taking frequent, short vacations throughout the year rather than taking just one or two longer ones. Preparing for a big vacation tended to be time-consuming and stressful. Not only that, but shorter trips usually ended up being less expensive, and she liked knowing her work wouldn’t pile up so much during her absence. Although she didn’t know where she would go for her next mini vacation after the trip to see her sister, she planned to make the journey before the warm days of summer were over.

Which of the following best summarizes the passage?

A.	Vanessa looks forward to visiting her sister.
B.	Vanessa looks for ways to economize on her trips.
C.	Vanessa enjoys taking time off when the weather is warm.
D.	Vanessa prefers taking short vacations rather than long ones.

I recently read about a deciduous tree, native to certain parts of Europe and Asia, known as the goat willow. The trees can live for up to 300 years, and they produce broad leaves that are eaten by a variety of insects, including the caterpillars of the purple emperor butterfly. This tree blooms in early spring, with male and female flowers growing on separate trees. You can tell the difference between the male and female flowers by their color and shape. Male flowers are oval, change from gray to yellow as they ripen with pollen, and have a furry appearance. In contrast, female flowers are green in color, are longer and more slender than their male counterparts, and after being pollinated will develop white woolly seeds. It’s the woolly hairs on the seeds that keep the species going, for they enable the seeds to be carried by the wind and start a new tree if they land on moist soil.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about goat willow flowers is correct?

A. 	Male flowers are a food source for purple emperor caterpillars.
B. 	Female flowers change from grey to yellow as they mature.
C. 	Female flowers grow on the same tree as the male flowers.
D. 	Male flowers are shorter and thicker than female flowers.

There are numerous types of honeysuckles that are native to temperate zones throughout the world, and each requires different care. The Lonicera japonica, or Japanese honeysuckle, may need its shoots cut back in the winter or spring to control its aggressive growth, but it does not require regular pruning. Other varieties that flower on the previous year’s growth, such as Lonicera periclymenum and Lonicera sempervirens, should be pruned after flowering. Some varieties, such as Lonicera nitida, are evergreen and need to be pruned several times between spring and fall. If left unchecked, the winter blooming Lonicera fragrantissima can reach 10 feet in height. However, if space is an issue, this variety can tolerate aggressive pruning. With the proper care, these versatile and long-lived plants will reward the gardener with their sweet perfume year after year.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about honeysuckle is correct?

A.	Lonicera nitida is an evergreen variety.

Having long admired the artistic craftsmanship of prose, I decided to kick off the first two months of the year by signing up for several creative writing workshops. Then, with the arrival of spring, I yearned to be outside a bit more, so I spent my mornings birdwatching in the park, and my afternoons playing chess in the community center. During the summer months, when I wasn’t volunteering at the food bank, I was at the public pool. It was there that a friend taught me how to dive. Finally, as fall approached, I tried my hand at oil painting, which turned out to be the most challenging endeavor of all.

Mark the center point by drawing a vertical line. Working from the center point outward, cover a small area with adhesive. Press each tile firmly into the adhesive with a small twist and set with a rubber float. Be sure to leave a small expansion gap between the tile and the countertop and allow room for grout between tiles. Repeat this process until the area is completely tiled, cutting tiles as necessary. Let the adhesive dry for at least 24 hours. Next, apply grout to the tiles using a diagonal motion, pressing it firmly into the joints. Wait ten minutes before wiping off the excess grout. After the grout has dried, apply grout sealer and caulk the expansion gap to finish.

To prepare for his arrival, I studied basic German words and phrases that I could use to make my guest feel more comfortable in my home. Then, I started taking German language lessons from my grandmother, who was born in Germany. She also taught me a little about the German culture by introducing me to German customs and teaching me German songs. By the end of six months, I was comfortable enough with my German skills that I could construct basic sentences. I was more adept at understanding than speaking, and my vocabulary was growing steadily. When the exchange student arrived this week, my desire to communicate on a deeper level in his native language inspired me to improve even more.

A solitary figure crossed the court on the pyramid, where the cluster of state buildings was located. Although he went toward the palace, he lagged like an unwelcome guest at a feast. The night was not cold but he shivered and wrapped his cloak around him. Behind him lay the great stone amphitheater, with its tier after tier of seats, vaulted by the starlit sky. To the north loomed the great temple, surmounted by its tower. The somber blackness was relieved only by the sacred fire that burned on top. Ahead of him reposed the royal palace, resplendent as a jewel in its setting of perfumed gardens. Sounds of music and revelry issued from the casement, and the guest stopped to take a deep breath of the sweet night air before he plunged into the hothouse brilliance beyond.

When she was only four years old, Tharpe was singing and playing guitar on stage with her mother, and in the mid-1920s, the two moved to Chicago, Illinois, where they continued to perform. While in Chicago, Tharpe developed a distinctive style of singing and playing that was shaped by her experience performing at church conventions and concerts.

As we ascended the hill the view became wondrously grand.

In winter it must be almost terrible to live there, but now it was beautiful beyond compare. We found, too, that the old house was somewhat sheltered, on the one hand by the great headland which rose higher as it neared the sea, and on the other by a thick, lofty wall. Besides this, a hill which rose up landward broke the force of the wind, so that it was not so exposed as I had at first thought.

The first category was periodicals, which includes magazines, journals, newspapers, and other publications issued on a regular basis. Contestants were given the titles of articles and had to guess which periodical had published the article. The next category was books. Contestants were asked to match book titles with authors, and they were granted additional points if they guessed the correct publication year. Then came the multimedia category; it tested contestants’ knowledge of some of the films available for checkout at the library. Finally, the game ended with the category of music.

However, the problem isn’t so much that Dot’s lapping is loud—it’s that she seems to take her drinks during the most unfortunate times, such as when I’m watching a movie, talking on the phone, or entertaining guests. For some reason, she rarely imbibes when noise isn’t a problem for me, like when I’m cooking, exercising, or cleaning the house.

By late March, the birds are singing, the flowers are blooming, and the days are noticeably longer. More daylight hours mean that I have time to go to the lake after work. There’s nothing better than launching my inflatable raft and drifting lazily on it while I unwind from the busy week. The water is still quite cool, so I don’t feel obligated to swim. The most energy I’ll expend is trailing a hand in the water if the sun feels a little too warm. The wind is also predictable at that time of year.

Just where the bridge knits together the two little villages of Pleasant River and Edgewood, the glassy mirror of the Saco broadens suddenly, sweeping over the dam in a luminous torrent. Gushes of pure amber mark the middle of the dam, with crystal and silver at the sides, and from the seething vortex beneath the golden cascade the white spray dashes up in fountains. In the crevices and hollows of the rocks the mad water churns itself into snowy froth, while the foam-flecked torrent, deep, strong, and troubled to its heart, sweeps majestically under the bridge, then dashes between wooded shores piled high with steep masses of rock, or torn and riven by great gorges.

The restaurant was a bit difficult to find, as it was located on the top floor of a warehouse. We ended up referring to online reviews for specific directions to the entrance. As we were shown to our seats—at one of the two long wooden tables that all diners shared—our server recited that night’s fixed menu. The chef, who was clearly passionate about cooking, actually served the food, and she seemed to enjoy conversing with the customers. Unfortunately, the lights in the restaurant were dimmed to such a degree that we could barely see what we were eating. However, the food was delicious, and the staff was very attentive. Bryce and I both agreed that it was one of our most memorable restaurant experiences.

There [Belle] sat, upon a low stool, doll and picture-book lying unheeded at her feet, as she watched the slanting beams of light which streamed in between the crimson curtains and poured life and gladness over all within the pleasant room. There she sat, watching them thoughtfully, yet with a half-smile upon her lips, as they travelled slowly and steadily from spot to spot, now over the carpet, now up the table-cloth, now touching the gilded mirror-frame and making it flash with added brightness, and now falling softly on a vase of lovely flowers and bringing out their brilliant colors in new and more perfect beauty.

And now it grew dark; the horizon began to redden and smolder; the stream gleamed like a wan thread among the distant fields. It was time to hurry home, to dip in the busy tide of life again. Where was my sad mood gone? The clear air seemed to have blown through my mind, hands had been waved to me from leafless woods, quiet voices of field and stream had whispered me their secrets; “We would tell, if we could,” they seemed to say. And I, listening, had learned patience, too—for a while.

Her books, which were much read and appreciated in the youth of the present middle-aged generation, may to some extent have sunk into the background, as the works of successive story-tellers do in the majority of cases retire, each in turn, before newer names and newer styles. But the splendid example set by Charlotte Tucker, at a time of life when most people are intent upon retiring from work, and taking if they may their ease,—an example of then buckling on her armor afresh, and of entering upon the toughest toil of all her busy life, will surely never be forgotten.

To the simple-hearted folk who dwelt in that island three thousand years ago, there was never a sweeter spot than sea-girt Ithaca.…There the air was always mild and pure, and balmy with the breath of blossoms; the sun looked kindly down from a cloudless sky, and storms seldom broke the quiet ripple of the waters which bathed the shores of that island home. On every side but one, the land rose straight up out of the deep sea to meet the feet of craggy hills and mountains crowned with woods. Between the heights were many narrow dells green with orchards; while the gentler slopes were covered with vineyards, and the steeps above them gave pasturage to flocks of long-wooled sheep and mountain-climbing goats.

If a metal or the salt of a metal be burned in a flame it imparts to the flame a distinctive color; table salt thrown into the fire burns with a yellowish flame, denoting the presence of sodium, and a greenish tint, indicating the combustion of chlorine. Violet flames accompany the burning of the salts of potassium, and barium burns green. Lithium and strontium give a red hue. But to be ordinarily perceptible, the salts require for the most part to be present in considerable quantities. By the use of the spectroscope, however, extremely small proportions of these metals and salts can be readily detected and classified.

In sending Grit to Boston instead of the regular messenger, President Graves had acted on his own responsibility, as he had a right to do, since it was a matter to be decided by the executive. He might, indeed, have consulted the directors, but that would have created delay, and might have endangered the needful secrecy. When, however, Grit returned and reported to him that his mission had been satisfactorily accomplished, he informed the directors of what had been done at a special meeting summoned at his own house. All approved the action except Mr. Courtney, who was prejudiced against Grit, and, moreover, felt offended because his own counsel had not been asked or regarded.

A careful examination of the cards fitting on the cylinder is absolutely necessary, otherwise a wrong lifting of the hooks destroying the cards by the pegs punching new holes would result. The cylinder with cards perfectly cut must be set so as to allow the needles to penetrate into the center of the holes stamped for them in the card. Sometimes the cylinder is set too high or too low—too far in front or too far in rear. To ascertain the proper position, lift the machine and place some paint, or grease from the machine, on the heads of the needles. Afterwards let the machine “fall in,” which will bring the cards against the heads of the needles, producing an impression and indicating the exact position of the needle-heads.

According to the passage, which of the following conditions could destroy a card?

B.	grease covering heads of the needles

Of all marine animals…the shark is, perhaps, one of the most unpopular. In general, it is difficult to give reason for the unpopularity or popularity of anything, but with reference to the shark, there is much reason to suppose that he has, by cruel misrepresentation, been exposed to unmerited dislike. Had he been altogether bad, it is most likely that he would have found a zealous advocate long ago; whereas, we are the first, we believe, whoever undertook to say a word in his defense. As a shark is thought to have many counterparts among the human species, we must be extremely careful how we launch our invectives at him, lest by direct implication we should abuse some of our most respectable fellow-citizens.

We were out all day in the thin sunshine, helping Mrs. Harling and Tony break the ground and plant the garden, dig around the orchard trees, tie up vines and clip the hedges. Every morning, before I was up, I could hear Tony singing in the garden rows. After the apple and cherry trees broke into bloom, we ran about under them, hunting for the new nests the birds were building, throwing clods at each other, and playing hide-and-seek with Nina. Yet the summer which was to change everything was coming nearer every day. When boys and girls are growing up, life can’t stand still, not even in the quietest of country towns; and they have to grow up, whether they will or no. That is what their elders are always forgetting.

Felt rugs are made to a certain extent in nearly every part of Persia, but chiefly at Ispahan, Astrabad, and Yezd. They are made of wool, goats’ hair or camels’ hair or of a combination of two or all of these substances, according to the color desired. As no dyes are employed and the finished product is the same in color as that of the materials used, they are usually gray, white or buff, most frequently the latter. The material is matted together by being pounded, occasionally sprinkled with water in which rapeseed-oil cakes have been soaked for a long time, and then pounded more until it becomes compact and solid. The finished product varies in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three inches and is as soft and pliable as cloth, but too heavy for exportation, consequently few come to Western markets.

According to the passage, the types of material used for a felt Persian rug were determined by the

I fell here again into the ancient road at Gilma; and, not satisfied with what I had seen of the beauties of Spaitla, I passed there five days more, correcting and revising what I had already committed to paper.

While there he secured data, mostly from the natives, from which he estimated the latitude and longitude of the source of the Yellowstone River. In his original manuscript journal and field notebooks, containing the record of his determinations, the words “Yellow Stone” appear precisely as used by Lewis and Clark in 1805.

Then lower the scarf into the bath very gradually without interrupting the working.

This type of vise will work all right, although rather clumsy and hard to tighten enough to hold the hook truly. Another simple vise is just a small pin chuck, soldered to one end of a ¼” brass rod, bent at the desired angle, and the other end of the rod soldered to a small C clamp. However, I prefer a vise of the cam lever type. That is, a vise that has a cam lever for opening and closing the jaws.

I sauntered through the various rooms, picked up a book in the library as an excuse and tried the door of the room behind. It was locked. I thought at first that something moved behind it, but if anything lived there it did not stir again. And yet I had a vivid impression that just on the other side of the door ears as keen as mine were listening. It was broad day, but I backed away from the door and out into the wide hall. My nerves were still raw, no doubt, from the night before.

3618.	The following excerpt is from Abbreviations and Signs by Frederick W. Hamilton (1918).

The use of abbreviations is as old as the use of alphabets. In inscriptions and on coins and in other places where room is limited they have always been used in order to save space. … In the manuscript period abbreviations were very extensively used. This was done partly to lighten the great labor of hand copying and partly to effect a double saving of expense, in labor and in costly material. Certain of these abbreviations were in common use and perfectly intelligible. Unfortunately the copyists did not limit their abbreviations to these, but devised others for their own use much to the discomfort of their readers, especially after the lapse of centuries.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	outline rules for using abbreviations.
B.	recount the early history of abbreviations.
C.	criticize abbreviations used by early copyists.
D.	argue the merit of standardized abbreviations.

My own vision requires no corrective lenses, but I’m quite interested in learning about eye conditions and how to treat them. With training and education, I’ll become skilled at observing patients and using instruments to determine their visual acuity, perception, focus, eye coordination, and even color blindness. I can hardly wait to help patients by prescribing and adjusting eyeglasses, contact lenses, and other vision aids. To work in my chosen profession, which excludes performing eye surgery, I’ll need a degree from an accredited optometry school and a state license to practice optometry. After I’ve been in practice a while, I may decide I would also like to diagnose glaucoma and treat special eye diseases by prescribing and dispensing medications. At that time, depending on what state I plan to work in, I’ll be required to complete other coursework or pass additional examinations to obtain additional certifications to perform those activities.

According to the passage, additional certification is required for a licensed optometrist to

A.	determine visual acuity.
B.	test for color blindness.
C.	prescribe eyeglasses.
D.	diagnose glaucoma.

They are composed of marine sedimentary rocks and volcanic rocks, as well as remnants of ancient ocean floor. They first formed about 480 million years ago when tectonic plates collided to form the supercontinent Pangea, and they are some of the oldest mountains in existence. The Appalachians are vestiges of the massive Central Pangean Mountains, which were near the center of Pangea before it began to break up. At one point, the Appalachian Mountains may have reached more than 30,000 feet high, but by the end of the Mesozoic Era, erosion had all but flattened them. However, starting about 65 million years ago during the Cenozoic Era, uplifting coupled with erosion has partially revealed the mountains’ ancient core material. The highest point of the Appalachians is now Mt. Mitchell, which stands at a height of 6,684 feet.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements about the Appalachian Mountains is correct?

A.	They formed along the eastern edge of Pangea.
B.	They were originally formed 65 million years ago.

They all actually come from the same type of plant—namely, the wild mustard plant, or Brassica oleracea. Careful artificial breeding by farmers over the course of thousands of years has led to different subspecies or “cultivars” of this plant. For example, the group acephala includes different types of kale and collards that are used for their leaves, whereas the botrytis group refers to cauliflower and certain broccoli cultivars. Brussels sprouts, or gemmifera, are another popular variety of the same plant, along with capitata, which includes white, red, and Savoy cabbage. These variations of the wild mustard plant occur when farmers select and breed plants that have certain desirable characteristics such as larger leaves or buds. While the various cultivars can look vastly different from each other, they are still considered the same species.

According to the passage, the gemmifera group of Brassica oleracea includes

A.	collards.

3623.	The term “greywater” describes wastewater that is discharged from sinks, bathtubs, showers, washing machines, and dishwashers. “Blackwater,” by contrast, is water discharged from toilets. The greywater approach to water conservation, which has become a global initiative, is the practice of treating greywater so that it can be repurposed for uses that do not require potable (drinkable) water, such as for flushing toilets or watering lawns. The typical person in the United States uses about 70 gallons of water per day—for drinking, cooking, bathing, flushing toilets, etc. Yet about half of that water, which is most likely potable, could be replaced with greywater. While some greywater treatment systems can be costly at first, they can save homeowners money in the long run. To help with the cost of greywater treatment systems, some cities in water-scarce regions of the U.S. offer rebates to homeowners, thereby helping to reduce potable water consumption.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Greywater treatment systems produce potable water for household use.
B.	Blackwater is treated by diverting it through a greywater treatment system.
C.	People in the U.S. could use greywater to replace about half of the drinkable water they use.

While several precursor ATMs were invented—such as the automatic-deposit machine called the Bankograph invented by Luther Simjian that used a built-in microfilm camera to document deposits—Don Wetzel’s 1969 model is generally considered the first modern ATM because it was the first to use plastic cards that stored information in magnetic strips. The invention would eventually revolutionize the banking industry, eliminating the need for customers to wait in line at a bank to make basic transactions. Today, there are millions of ATMs around the world, and they are installed not only in financial institutions but also in malls, pharmacies, cruise ships, gas stations, and many other places. There are even ATMs located in extremely remote locations, such as McMurdo Station in Antarctica.

Although usually published as a trilogy—subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, respectively—the story actually consists of six books, two per section or volume. The books are not titled in most editions and are simply numbered I through VI, but, as documented in a 1959 letter to his publisher, Tolkien suggested that a subtitle be used for each book. Tolkien’s suggestion was as follows: The Fellowship of the Ring should include “The Ring Sets Out” and “The Ring Goes South,” The Two Towers should consist of “The Treason of Isengard” and “The Ring Goes East,” and The Return of the King should include “The War of the Ring” and “The End of the Third Age.” However, Tolkien’s publisher ultimately made the decision not to include Tolkien’s suggested book titles in The Lord of the Rings.

Based on the passage, Tolkien suggested that the book immediately after “The Ring Goes South” be called

From the spreading of the Teutonic tribes, new nations were formed in Western Europe. The Franks pressed into Northern Gaul. Their name remains in Franconia, and in that portion of Gaul called France. In Italy, Spain, and Aquitaine, the Goths and other Teutonic peoples mingled with the Romans. From the Latin language, corrupted and mixed up with other tongues, arose the Italian, Spanish, Provencal, and French languages, all, from the name of Rome, called the Romance languages. The eastern empire still went on; in the sixth century it recovered for a time Italy and Africa. Its people called themselves Romans, but were not so much Roman as Greek.

This was the time when Roman law was driving German law out of Germany or forcing it to conceal itself in humble forms and obscure corners. If this was the age of the Renaissance and the age of the Reformation, it was also the age of the “Reception.” I need not say that this Reception—the reception of Roman law—plays a large part in modern versions of German history, and by no means only in such as are written by lawyers. I need not say that it has been judged from many different points of view, that it has been connected by some with political, by others with religious and by yet others with economic changes. Nor need I say that of late years few writers have had a hearty good word for the Reception. We have all of us been nationalists of late. Cosmopolitanism can afford to await its turn.

3628.	The Greek philosopher Aristotle developed the first widely used biological classification system or taxonomy in the Western world. His system included two main groups of living things: plants and animals. The animal group was further divided by their distinguishing features. Although Aristotle’s classification system had its limitations, it was used for nearly 2,000 years and influenced the science of taxonomy. In the 1700s, Swedish biologist Carolus Linnaeus, now known as the “father of taxonomy,” was the first scientist to consistently apply binomial nomenclature in naming organisms and used hierarchical ordering of groups. The Linnaean system started with plant, animal, and mineral groups, which Linnaeus called “kingdoms,” and the living kingdoms were further divided into class, order, genus, and species. Although a modified version of Linnaeus’s system is still used today, improved technologies, such as DNA sequencing, continue to alter the way we think about relationships between organisms.

In Newton’s day the whole field of nature was practically lying fallow. No fundamental principles were known until the law of gravitation was discovered. This law was behind all the work of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, and what they had done needed interpretation. It was quite natural that the most obvious and mechanical phenomena should first be reduced, and so [Newton’s] Principia was concerned with mechanical principles applied to astronomical problems. To us, who have grown up familiar with the principles and conceptions underlying them, all varieties of mechanical phenomena seem so obvious, that it is difficult for us to understand how anyone could be obtuse to them; but the records of Newton’s time, and immediately after this, show that they were not so easy of apprehension.

This might be due in part to the nearby gift shop, which was selling this type of kite at a discount. Charles was intrigued by the kites in unusual shapes, such as the ones that resembled sea creatures or birds. Today, his favorite kite was shaped like an airplane, its propeller spinning and its three-foot-long tail fluttering in the wind. Charles lowered his eyes to watch fellow kite fliers. A team of people was keeping a very large dragon kite aloft. It was impressive how the fliers managed to keep the kite in the air without colliding with each other or getting the strings tangled. He wondered what the criteria would be for joining such a team.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Charles is planning to buy a kite shaped like a sea creature.
B.	The dragon-shaped kite was bought at the local gift shop.
C.	The airplane kite was handled by a team of fliers.
D.	Charles has a kite in the typical diamond shape.

They needed to rest anyway, so they faced the distant cliff wall and shouted out words to see how well the sound reflected back to them. The first word they tried out was a loud “hello,” which came back as “lo, lo, lo.” Next, they tried yelling “hi,” which came back as “i, i, i.”  Casey thought maybe his name would echo back in full, but much to his disappointment, the echo sounded like “asey, asey, asey.” Then, Joe tried yelling out his own name, and the brothers felt a sense of satisfaction when they heard a perfect “Joe, Joe, Joe” reflected across the canyon.

The guidelines were clear and simple: the contestants could choose any dance genre, and they had a maximum of three minutes onstage. Shortly after she received a scoresheet and pencil to record her ratings, the competition began. First onstage was a lively samba performance, followed by a couple dancing the tango. A short break gave the judges a chance to discuss their ratings on the first two performances to make sure their scores were fairly consistent and that all the judges fully understood the grading process. After the break, an elegant waltz was performed. The final entry was an intricate contemporary dance routine performed by a group of five dancers. Overall, Theresa was pleased with the quality of the performances at the event.

Sure, it was hard waking up as early as 4:30 in the morning to mow the grass, but, to her, there was nothing like tending the fairway in the rose-gold light of a sunrise. Michelle wasn’t completely alone on the golf course at this hour either; several deer could usually be spotted near the ninth hole feeding on the grass, and often squirrels frolicked in the tree branches. Once, she even saw a bobcat cross a putting green.

Nestled in a small clearing near the lakeshore and dwarfed by the surrounding snowcapped peaks, the simple chalet-style structure looked like something out of a fairy tale. Its best feature, aside from the setting, was the famous observation deck that offered guests a comfortable place to sit, relax, and enjoy the spectacular view. We spent our days hiking and exploring the lake in a rowboat. But no matter what, we always made sure we returned to the observation deck in time to watch the sun go down. I cherish the picture the hotel proprietor took of us on the deck with the lake and the sunset in the background.

As a result, he was thrilled when his supervisor asked him to help open a satellite office in the state of Goa in western India. Dominic’s knowledge of India, to a large degree, stems from his ancestor’s account of her year on the west coast in Mumbai (then called Bombay) in the late 1800s. She was a prolific writer, and her journal entries depicting the way of life, people, architecture, and politics of India were both vivid and informative. In anticipation of finding tremendous changes since his relative’s travels, Dominic decided to bring a copy of her journal with him to India and document his own experiences side-by-side with hers.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	Dominic is excited about working in India.

The Flanders coast consists mainly of flat country barely elevated above the level of the sea. Sand hills along the shore act as a barrier between the sea and the land. Parallel to the shore the tidal current runs to and fro with considerable velocity. The tendency for the tidal current to wash away the sand from the shore is partially countered by the use of groins [seawalls], such as are similarly used to maintain our own coastline in many parts of England. Although the groins on the Flanders coast are carried well out into the sea—they are often 100 yards in length—the movement of sand along the coast is very considerable, and, as will be explained later, has a strong influence on the harbor situation in that locality.

In discussing the Flanders coast, the author’s primary focus is on the

A.	elevation of the land.
B.	control of beach erosion.
C.	direction of the tidal currents.
D.	sand-hill barrier along the shore.

As a young adult, she received formal art training at several institutions in New York City. In the 1930s, she secured a position as an artist in the Mural Division of the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Art Project. This initiative, sponsored by the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, was the United States government’s first major attempt at sponsoring the visual arts and allowed Krasner to explore her work on a large scale. Over the course of her long career, Krasner created grand murals and also worked in collage and printmaking as she continually experimented with different artistic approaches. Although often overshadowed by her gifted husband, painter Jackson Pollock, she is considered a notable artist of the Abstract Expressionist movement in her own right.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Krasner immigrated to the U.S. from Russia.

After her family left Germany in 1939, Hesse studied abstract painting and commercial design in New York City and briefly pursued a career as a commercial textile designer. Soon, however, she began incorporating nontraditional materials into her work, forming sculptures out of discarded rubber, string, wire, plastic, and other everyday “found” objects. One of her final works was a flexible hanging web of loosely tangled rope dipped in latex and suspended at various points from the ceiling. Employing imaginative, innovative techniques such as this, Hesse created works that reflected her own emotional battles and helped bring to prominence a new kind of psychologically intense art.

Based on the passage, which of the following is a correct statement about Hesse?

A.	She preferred painting to sculpting.
B.	She began her art education in Germany.
C.	She used unconventional materials in her work.
D.	She moved to New York to design commercial textiles.

3656.	The Minimalist art movement, which emphasized simplicity and objectivity, emerged during the 1960s as a reaction against the highly emotional and subjective art of the Abstract Expressionist movement, which the minimalists felt had become tired and conventional. Minimalist works may combine painting and sculpture and are characterized by extremely simple design elements in solid colors with hard edges. For example, Donald Judd placed a series of prefabricated, identical rectangular prisms on a wall from floor to ceiling, and Tony Smith created a 500-pound metal cube of hot-rolled steel. These artists refrained from incorporating metaphorical references, overt symbolism, or anything else that could be considered emotional or expressive; they believe that art should produce a response based only on the physical form and the space that it occupies. By the late 1970s, Minimalism had become popular in the United States and Europe, and the work that defines this era is some of the most distinctive art of the twentieth century.

According to the passage, one of the characteristics of Minimalism is its use of

A.	distorted forms.
B.	geometric shapes.
C.	symbolic elements.
D.	exaggerated colors.

If it’s new, simply sweep it with a broom, but if it’s old, pressure wash it to remove all the debris. Next, plan a staining route with a stopping point that allows for easy exit off the deck after the last section is stained. Once the route is planned and the deck is clean and dry, tape off any adjoining exterior walls to protect them from being stained. Then, put the can of stain on a drop cloth and stir it using a paint stirrer to ensure an even mixture. Before pouring the stain into a paint tray, place a few clean rags nearby to mop up any spills. It is a good idea to paint the vertical surfaces, such as the posts, before the horizontal surfaces. Be sure to allow the stain to dry thoroughly between coats.

Based on the passage, what should be done just after cleaning the deck?

A.	Plan a staining route.
B.	Set out a few clean rags.
C.	Tape off adjoining exterior walls.
D.	Put the can of stain on a drop cloth.

When building a sand court in a relatively small area, such as a backyard, allow enough room for the court itself plus a generous free zone surrounding the court for safety. Mark the boundaries of the court area and then excavate the top layer of soil to a depth of about two feet. Remove any large rocks or roots and then rake the soil before compacting the ground with a rammer. Once the ground is flat and level, build concrete footings for the poles and then cover the bottom of the court with an even layer of gravel for drainage. After covering the gravel with landscape fabric, fill the remainder of the excavated area with sand. Finally, attach the net to the poles and you are ready to play!

I’m glad to hear that you are interested in one of our end-of-year closeout vehicles. As the listing states, this car is five years old with approximately 30,000 miles—the previous owner seldom drove the car. Since the car is so new, there is still some coverage with the manufacturer’s warranty. The car has had only one owner, and it received regular maintenance per the manufacturer’s recommendations. There was a new battery installed in the car just before it was traded in, and the tires were rotated and balanced at that time as well. Additionally, the interior of the car is immaculate. At this price, the car will most likely sell quickly, so contact me soon for a test drive.

The use of this real estate [the state of Massachusetts] as banking capital would break up all monopolies in banking, and in all other business depending upon bank loans. It would diffuse credit much more widely than it has ever been diffused. It would reduce interest to the lowest rates to which free competition could reduce it. It would give immense activity and power to industrial and commercial enterprise. It would multiply machinery, and do far more to increase production than any other system of credit and currency that has ever been invented. And being furnished at low rates of interest, would secure to producers a much larger share of the proceeds of their labor, than they now receive.

It is used to denote 1,000 of something, such as 1,000 grams or 1,000 meters as in the words kilogram and kilometer. The prefix, a French modification of the Greek word khilioi, emerged in 1790s France when the metric system was first adopted there. Similarly, the prefix kilo is used for another measurement unit, kilowatt. Modern electricity providers use kilowatt-hours to measure their customers’ electricity consumption. The first documented use of the word kilo in the English language, for kilogram, was in 1870. Decades later, in 1951, kilo was selected to represent the letter K in the universal phonetic alphabet used for civil aviation. A modified version of this phonetic alphabet is still in use today.

After I have been at my desk for an hour or so, I stop whatever I’m doing and stretch my arms out wide and reach overhead as far as I can. After another hour, I slowly roll my neck clockwise and then counterclockwise. I eat a small lunch around noon, and then I take a walk outside to get some exercise and some fresh air. In the middle of the afternoon, when I tend to feel a little sleepy, I stand up and do 20 squats. These short breaks don’t take me away from my work for long. In fact, I feel that doing these exercises increases my productivity and improves the quality of my work.

What is the correct order of exercises performed, from first to last?

A.	neck rolls, arm stretches, squats, walk
B.	neck rolls, squats, arm stretches, walk
C.	arm stretches, neck rolls, walk, squats
D.	arm stretches, walk, neck rolls, squats

In fact, one of my earliest memories is of sitting with my father in the old pickup truck and watching a long freight train pass by. When I was a kid, I would often try to count the train cars, but I usually gave up long before the caboose. Part of my trouble with counting the cars was that the shipping containers would distract me. I always wondered what was in them, where they were going, and where they had come from. To this day, the sound of a train whistle and the clacking of the wheels along the tracks take me straight back to my hometown.

The main point of the passage is that the author

A.	wonders what is carried by shipping containers on trains.
B.	remembers childhood experiences related to trains.
C.	spent a lot of time waiting for trains to pass by.
D.	used to try to count the train cars.

Despite my careful planning, there is always one sight that did not get seen, one museum that didn’t get visited, or one picture that didn’t get taken. This is the case not only with vacations to faraway places, but also with vacations spent right here at home. Even if I think I have accomplished everything on my list, when the last few hours roll around, and I realize that a return to everyday life is imminent, it’s normal for me to try to squeeze in one more activity before the vacation ends. I really should learn to relax more and remember that there will be other vacations.

Which of the following best restates the author’s main point?

A.	Vacations typically end with some activities left undone.
B.	Vacations are enjoyable even when they are spent at home.
C.	It is important to plan carefully before embarking on a vacation.
D.	It can be difficult to return to the regular routine after a vacation.

My neighbor Barry, on the other hand, hasn’t yet made up his mind. As usual, each of the candidates promises to put an end to rising taxes while at the same time improving city services. Although Barry has spent a lot of time analyzing the strengths and weakness of each mayoral hopeful, whenever he reads or hears something new about a candidate, he changes his mind about his vote. At this point, everyone on my block except for Barry has put up a yard sign endorsing one candidate or another, and some of my more politically active neighbors have even been going door-to-door and making get-out-the-vote phone calls in their spare time.

The author most likely wrote the passage in order to

A.	praise political activism.
B.	convince Barry to vote wisely.
C.	criticize Barry’s indecisiveness.

Even when we send patients reminders—politely informing them that “an appointment missed by you is an appointment missed by two”— a surprising number of patients fail to show up for their scheduled appointments. Yesterday, for example, we had four no-shows, and not one of them bothered to call our office to cancel or reschedule. I repeatedly remind patients who are habitual no-shows that missed appointments waste resources and that their allotted time could have been given to someone else had they called ahead to cancel. Apparently, the no-show patients care little, if at all, about their doctor’s valuable time.

Without hesitating I groped around, feeling the stones in the dark, and my feet trod a soil which seemed familiar but which had not been trodden for centuries. I seemed to know these very stones, forgotten in the darkness of those cellars. I slid the length of the damp flagstones as if I had been accustomed to the way. My fingernails came in contact with sharp stones in the wall and I counted the seams as I passed. I knew that if I turned round I would see a certain square light in the distant gallery, a single ray in all this place where the sun had forgotten to shine since France’s history had begun.

I cannot bear their perfume; it comes up in great breaths, when the window is opened. I wish that little cricket, just waked from his winter’s nap, would not sit there on the sill and chirp at me.

Everybody seemed bright and cheerful. There were still two more jurors to be secured when court convened. Never in all his experience had Sampson seen a judge on the bench who behaved so beautifully as this one. He looked as though he never had had a grouch in his life, and as if he really enjoyed listening to the same old questions over and over again. Occasionally he interjected a question or an interpolation that must have been witty, for he graciously permitted his hearers to laugh with him; and at no time was he cross or domineering. His hair, carefully brushed, was sleekly plastered into an enduring neatness, and his mustache was never so smartly trimmed and twisted as it was on this sprightly morning.

[W]e cast the ship loose, and endeavored to force our way forward among the ice; until, from its increasing consolidation, we were again obliged to lash to a large piece of it. This operation is called grappling; and it is performed by running the vessel alongside of the piece of ice to which it is intended to make her fast: two men then leap on the ice: the one runs, with a sort of pickaxe, to dig a hole in it, using the precaution to stand with his back to the ship; and the other man follows the first, with a serpent-like iron on his back, having a strong rope affixed to one end of it: this serpent (or ice-anchor, as it is termed) is hooked into the hole on the ice, and the rope is fastened on board the ship. Other ice-anchors and ropes are then hooked to different parts of the piece of ice; and the number of ropes is varied according to the state of the weather.

A merry school of porpoises, a square mile of them, suddenly appear, tossing themselves into the air in abounding strength and hilarity, adding foam to the waves and making all the wilderness wilder.

On examination of the room (which is only seven feet high), a trap door in the ceiling, leading out on to the roof of the house, was discovered open. The short ladder, used for obtaining access to the trap door (and kept under the bed), was found placed at the opening, so as to enable any person or persons, in the room, to leave it again easily. In the trap door itself was found a square aperture cut in the wood, apparently with some exceedingly sharp instrument, just behind the bolt which fastened the door on the inner side. In this way, any person from the outside could have drawn back the bolt, and opened the door, and have dropped (or have been noiselessly lowered by an accomplice) into the room—its height, as already observed, being only seven feet. That some person, or persons, must have got admission in this way, appears evident from the fact of the aperture being there.

Coming home, a party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance.

In order to study the principles of music and drawing, Galileo found it necessary to acquire some knowledge of geometry. His father seems to have foreseen the consequences of following this new pursuit, and though he did not prohibit him from reading Euclid under Ostilio Ricci, one of the professors at Pisa, yet he watched his progress with the utmost jealousy, and had resolved that it should not interfere with his medical studies. The demonstrations, however, of the Greek mathematician had too many charms for the ardent mind of Galileo. His whole attention was engrossed with the new truths which burst upon his understanding; and after many fruitless attempts to check his ardor and direct his thoughts to professional objects, his father was obliged to surrender his parental control, and allow the fullest scope to the genius of his son.

My needle is slow to settle,—varies a few degrees, and does not always point due southwest, it is true, and it has good authority for this variation, but it always settles between west and south-southwest. The future lies that way to me, and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side.

What those buildings had been used for in other days was not obvious to the casual and careless observer, but to the least observant their present use was obvious enough. Here were piles of timber from Norway; there were stacks of slate from Wales; here was marble from Aberdeen, and there cement from Portland: the old chambers of the grey buildings were filled to overflowing with all the things that go towards making a house—ironwork, zinc, lead, tiles, great coils of piping, stores of domestic appliances.

“The Great North Road” and “The Famous Bath Road” vary greatly throughout their length as to width and excellence; and yet popular opinion in the south of England would seem to indicate that these roads, to single them out from among others, are idyllic, both in character of surface and skill of engineering, throughout their length. This is manifestly not so. The “Bath Road,” for example, in parts, is as flat and well-formed a surface as one could hope to find, even in France itself, but at times it degenerates into a mere narrow, guttery alley, especially in its passage through some of the Thames-side towns, where the surface is never of that excellence that it should be; throughout its entire length of some hundred odd miles to Bath there are ever-recurring evidence of bad road-making and worse engineering.

The English named the colony New York in recognition of the Duke of York, who had plotted the takeover. The following year, on June 22, 1665, Nicoll appointed an Englishman named Captain Thomas Willett to serve as New York’s first mayor. Nicoll felt that Willet, fluent in both English and Dutch and with ties to both governments, was ideally suited to lead the city’s transition from Dutch to English rule. Willet’s connections with the Dutch, however, did not help him in 1673, when the Dutch temporarily regained control of New York.

On my most recent trip, without even going out of my way, I was fortunate to witness at least one top-notch jazz performance every day. On my first evening in the city, a jazz duo just happened to be performing at the restaurant where I had dinner. The next morning, while walking through a park, I stopped to watch a trumpet player execute a stirring rendition of one of Louis Armstrong’s hits.

We knew some basic facts about kangaroos, but we didn’t know about the different types of kangaroos. There’s a musky rat-kangaroo that has a tail up to six inches long and weighs less than a pound, and there’s even a kangaroo that lives in the trees. The front limbs of a tree kangaroo have much greater strength than those of other kangaroos, a feature that enables it to inhabit and climb trees. That day, we were able to see the red kangaroo, which is the largest marsupial, or pouched mammal, in the world. My nephew was particularly impressed with the remarkable strength of the hind legs on this 180-pound animal. A docent told us that these kangaroos can hop about 30 miles per hour at full speed. That’s still not as fast as gray kangaroos, who can also clear heights of over 9 feet. We were all thrilled to learn so much while visiting these fascinating creatures.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Red kangaroos hop faster than gray ones.
B.	Gray kangaroos weigh more than red ones.
C.	Musky rat-kangaroos have longer tails than tree kangaroos.
D.	Tree kangaroos have stronger arms than musky rat-kangaroos.

The group decided to split up into pairs to see which team would reach the center first. Salina and Toby figured that, even if they made many wrong turns, they could still win by moving faster than the others. Georgia and her sister Jenna paused to orient themselves at each junction. They had an advantage because they had successfully completed the maze on a previous visit. Gabriel and Gene’s strategy was to document every one of their turns. Although doing so would slow them down, they figured they would be able to breeze through and win the next race by following their own directions. Seth and Thomas didn’t think they could beat Georgia and Jenna, so they just decided to make all right-hand turns and see what would happen. Much to their surprise, they were the first team to reach the center.

The days after leaving Monte Video passed swiftly enough, as it had got comparatively cool, and we were able to have all kinds of games on deck. After seven days at sea, early one morning we sighted Cape Virgins, which commands the northeastern entrance to the Strait of Magellan. The southeastern point is called Cape Espiritu Santo; the distance between the two capes being about twenty-two miles. Whilst we were threading the intricate passage of the First Narrows, which are not more than two miles broad, I scanned with interest the land I had come so many thousand miles to see—Patagonia at last! Desolate and dreary enough it looked, a succession of bare plateaus, not a tree nor a shrub visible anywhere; a grey, shadowy country, which seemed hardly of this world; such a landscape, in fact, as one might expect to find on reaching some other planet.

Soon, the light would change and the beachgoers would arrive and scare away all the shorebirds. He planned to take quite a few photographs so that he could select the best one to use as his source material. Then, he would return home to digitally process the raw images, scale the desired image to match the scale of his canvas, and print the scaled image. However, before he could sit down at his easel, he would need to take the print to a shop to have it laminated. That way, he could check all of his paint colors against his photograph without damaging the print. His profession required a lot of time and effort, and these first few steps were just a necessary part of the process.

Our lineup for each season includes four of the most popular plays from the previous season, based on ticket sales and reviews. We also present one new production each season. If the new productions prove to be popular with our audience, they might be carried over into the next season. Typically, the older and widely known plays are the most attended performances, and these productions usually cover our expenses for the entire season. Most performances take place at the community center, but when we expect a larger audience and the weather cooperates, we’ll use the stage at the local fairgrounds. Our mission is to enchant our audience while supporting new playwrights and actors.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

We either eat them fresh or bake them with cinnamon. But there is no other fruit that I enjoy more than apricots; they are my favorite.

Seeing an advertisement for new cast members for an upcoming musical performance, I decided to try to take my enthusiasm to the stage. I studied a recording of show tunes and practiced one of them till I knew it by heart. In front of the community theater director, I gave the song my best shot, trying to reach all the high notes and not forget any of the lyrics. I thought I sounded great, but that might have been because of the professional pianist who accompanied all the auditioning vocalists. Afterwards, the director told me that the names of selected performers would be posted along with the rehearsal schedule.

Although fashion bracelets with a time-telling component have been a part of women’s fashion since the early 1900s, they didn’t catch on with men until World War I. During that time, soldiers on the battlefield were using makeshift wristwatches—pocket watches crudely strapped to their wrists—as a practical alternative to wearing a pocket watch concealed in their uniforms. They found that, compared to pocket watches, wristwatches were much easier to access and were therefore the better option during battle. As a result, manufacturers began designing watches whose durability and functionality would appeal to civilians as well as soldiers. By World War II the wristwatch had become so popular that pocket watches had become virtually obsolete.

Now those ten years had made it shrink to a lonely, crumbling building that overlooked the harbor mouth. Clematis had swarmed over the bricks, a tangle of dead and living vines.

First of all, staying cool and hydrated is important, so I always keep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator and have plenty of ice cube trays ready and waiting on my freezer shelves. Furthermore, chocolate chips used for baking are best kept in airtight packaging and stored in the refrigerator because, during the summer, they could melt if stored on a pantry shelf. The same thing applies to butter. When I lived in a cooler climate, I left butter on the countertop so it would be easier to spread. These days, my butter stays in the refrigerator. I’ve also learned to keep my spice jars fresh and protect them from the humidity by leaving them in the freezer.

She firmly believes that the best way to foster creativity and promote a helpful, responsible attitude among her cast and crew is to set a high standard and then interfere as little as possible. However, on the last day of filming each season, Amy delivers an uncharacteristically long-winded speech in which she thanks everyone and talks about how their ratings are going thus far. During her speech four seasons ago, she announced that the show had been moved to a prime time slot. At the end of season three, she broke the news that the show had been nominated for best television series. After season five’s filming had wrapped, she revealed that the show had been renewed for another two seasons. Clearly, Amy’s signature directorial style is working.

According to the passage, the show was nominated for an award at the end of season

A.	two.
B.	three.

She enjoyed working with students in the classroom but was ready to take on a leadership role. With the current vice principal retiring at the end of the school year, this would be the perfect opportunity to try to further her career. Through her interactions with vice principals over the years, Imani knew that the position required many of the skills she already possessed, such as the ability to work well with parents and other teachers, think on her feet, and communicate effectively. If she were given the job, Imani would investigate the feasibility of hiring additional office staff to relieve the faculty of as many administrative tasks as possible, allowing them to focus primarily on teaching. As soon as the vacancy was posted, Imani submitted her application and started preparing for her interview.

He needed a space that already had a commercial kitchen and, preferably, an outdoor seating area. He had viewed several spaces, but few had the amenities he desired, and those that did lacked adequate foot traffic. After several weeks of looking, he finally found a property on a busy corner with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the street. In addition, it was within walking distance of the community hospital and an industrial office park.

She carefully unrolled the rug on the floor and was amazed to discover that, after over a century of use, the weaving on the still-brightly colored rug remained tight and even. Dibe could remember visitors to her grandmother’s home admiring the rug. Its bold symmetrical design and rich colors really were stunning. According to her mother, who had played on the rug as a child, Dibe’s great-grandmother had woven the rug from wool that she had spun and dyed herself. Looking at the beautiful rug made Dibe want to learn how to weave a rug of her own and carry on the family tradition.

When steam was introduced as an auxiliary naval power source in the 1820s, paddlewheels were the initial method of propulsion. In the late 1830s engineers began working with propellers—“screws” in naval terminology. Each technology had its partisans: the sidewheel provided greater combat maneuverability, was suited to riverine warfare, and presented no problems of leakage, as did the screw’s underwater shaft hole. However, the exposed wheels were vulnerable during combat, ate up deck space needed for guns, hindered sail handling, and created more drag than a screw when the vessel was under sail. The launching of the screw warships H.M.S. Rattler in Britain and U.S.S. Princeton in the United States in 1843 signaled the coming ascendancy of screw propulsion.

In discussing the propulsion of naval warships, the author’s primary focus is on the

A.	challenge of designing for greater speed.
B.	pros and cons of sidewheels and propellers.
C.	use of steam as a secondary source of power.

At the time of the dictionary’s publication in 1604, the English language was just beginning to gain respect. In fact, prior to this work, dictionaries that contained English words were bilingual dictionaries written for English speakers who wanted to study more refined languages, such as Latin or French. However, when Table Alphabeticall was published, English was starting to become a more notable language, a language that was worthy of having its own dictionary. Cawdrey’s dictionary defined only about 3,000 English words—those that Cawdrey considered to be difficult and unusual—and included only simple definitions. Despite its small number of words, by today’s standards, Cawdrey’s Table Alphabeticall laid the foundation for the modern English dictionary.

Twenty million years ago, all the coal we have or shall have had been packed away beneath the ribs of the earth, in seams varying in height from sixty feet to the thickness of a blade of grass. In many places the flat layers in which it was first deposited had been thrown into overlapping folds. Some of it had been subjected to comparatively little heat and to the pressure only of the rocky strata above it; this is the bituminous, which is still rich in oils, gas, tar—unreleased volatile matter. Some had been crushed by the weight of uplifted mountains, roasted, fused, and burned by molten lava and volcanic flame; this is anthracite, which is almost pure carbon and ash. Some had been exposed to greater pressure still, to [more] intense heat; this is graphite, which can no longer be burned at all.

A.	difficulty of extracting coal from seams of various sizes.

Year-round school schedules can vary, but most alternative schedules have students attending class for 45 to 60 days followed by 15 to 20 days of vacation. Although the total number of instructional days in a year is generally the same for both traditional schools and year-round schools, students attending year-round schools enjoy a few weeks off between quarters. With shorter breaks students may be more likely to retain what they have learned from one quarter to the next. Also, having more frequent breaks allows students and teachers to recharge before starting a new session.

But Kate is the heroine of the band, and the ‘peculiar quality of cherubic dowdiness’ of her youngsters, the winsomeness of the babies’ solemn flirtation under an immense umbrella, and similar fascinating scenes, received the appreciation that was their due.

The summer scenes of “Way Down East” were made at Farmington and at the Mamaroneck studio. Griffith had selected a fine cast, among them Lowell Sherman, the villain; Burr McIntosh, as Squire Bartlett; Kate Bruce, his wife; Mary Hay, their niece; and Vivia Ogden, the village gossip. The scene where Squire Bartlett drives Anna Moore from his home was realistic in its harshness, and poor Burr McIntosh, a sweet soul who long before had played Taffy in “Trilby,” and who loved Lillian dearly, could never get over having been obliged to turn her out into the storm.

According to the passage, what character turned Lillian’s character Anna out into the storm?

The road from the Ellis homestead up to Arlington lies through the woods, and has all the charm of a road that has been left to follow its own way—and a sweet, wild way at that. There were no fences, either new or old, for none were needed. On each side a forest of oak, interspersed with an occasional maple or chestnut, stretched miles away, with seldom a glimpse of a clearing, while immediately bordering the road grew the veriest tangle of a natural hedgerow, abloom with some sort of sweet wildflower from May to October. The original cut through the wood had been happily a wide one, and so sunshine and shower even, after all these years, still had abundant chance to slant this way and that across the road and coax every growing thing to perfection.

According to the passage, which of the following features is nearest to the side of the road?

A Petoskey stone, the official state stone of Michigan, is a fossilized colonial coral that consists of many very tightly packed, six-sided skeletons of coral polyps. When the surface of the stone is wet, a pattern —hexagonal shapes, each with a dark center and fine lines extending outwards—is quite visible. The name Petoskey comes from the American Indian word “Pet-O-Sega,” which translates from the Ottawa language to “rays of the rising sun.” Furthermore, Pet-O-Sega was the name of an esteemed Ottawa Chief, landowner, and businessman; and in 1873, a settlement on the Bear River was named Petoskey in his honor. Ancient glaciers dispersed the Petoskey stones throughout the area, and savvy collectors search for specimens not just along the beaches of the lake, but also in road cuts, gravel pits, and farm fields.

Based on the passage, which of the following statements is correct?

A.	Petoskey stones are hexagonally shaped.
B.	Pet-O-Sega discovered the Petoskey stone.
C.	Petoskey stones are pieces of fossilized coral.
D.	Pet-O-Sega was named after the Petoskey stone.

When the meeting was over, my colleagues and I spent the weekend exploring the region. Our first stop was the shore of Lake Superior to enjoy a day at the waterfront. The lake was chilly but crystal clear. The next day, we ventured over to the Whitefish Point Lighthouse, one of the first lighthouses on Lake Superior. Afterwards, we visited Tahquamenon Falls State Park. After a season of heavy rain, the falls at the park were astoundingly beautiful.

First, he retrieved the mail and took it inside. Then, he watered the houseplants and fed the goldfish. Since it was garbage collection day, he took the garbage bin to the curb and then swept up a few leaves that had fallen on the front porch. Scott was about to lock up the house and leave when he noticed that the small patch of grass in the front yard was looking a little untidy, so he retrieved the lawn mower from the garage and mowed the lawn. All of these tasks took him only 25 minutes to complete, and tomorrow’s visit would be even quicker, because he probably wouldn’t need to sweep the porch, and he definitely wouldn’t need to take out the garbage or mow the lawn.

We were able to identify this butterfly by the bold white band running across its black wings. Next, we saw a monarch, perhaps the best-known butterfly, recognizable by its black and orange wings peppered with white dots, and then an American copper, which also has orange and black coloration. We then saw a butterfly I had never seen before: a silver-spotted skipper. This butterfly has mottled brown and orange wings adorned with a silvery-white patch that is visible when its wings are closed. As we were leaving the butterfly house, we were excited to spot a little glassywing, which is a type of butterfly rarely seen in our area.

One day there was a ring at the door in the lane, followed by a loud and impatient rat-a-tat. A gentleman, who was a stranger to me, hurled himself across the threshold. He wore the frown of one who is intensely in earnest, whose mind is very much occupied. His mustaches were the fiercest and most eager that I ever saw on any man. They stuck out at right angles from under his nose like a pair of shaving-brushes. They were of an extraordinary purplish color, and would have done credit to a pirate. But his dress was more clerical than seafaring. It consisted of a black frock coat, bound with braid at the edges where the cloth was fretted; his vest was low-cut to display an ocean of white shirt, above which a small tie of black silk wobbled.

I suppose it was a mistake to store my ginger in the same bowl as the garlic and to listen to my favorite radio program while preparing dinner. The mistake did not reveal itself until my guests took their first bites of the dish. They immediately detected its potent ginger flavor. That was when I realized I had used minced ginger instead of minced garlic in the tomato sauce, which definitely wasn’t a good substitution in my eggplant parmesan. As I ruefully dialed the number for pizza delivery, I promised my guests that I would keep the ginger and garlic in separate containers from now on.

The ice cream cones were dripping over their hands and then running down their forearms and nearly splattering on their shoes on this hot summer day. It helped somewhat that they had each ordered a single rather than a double scoop. Admittedly, the taste of the ice cream was worth the messiness of eating it, and between licks, Will and Jo thanked Carrie for suggesting that they pull over after seeing the inviting roadside sign. Fortunately, Jo had remembered to grab napkins, and Will had a bottle of water in the car so they could easily clean up afterwards.

During our last match, I noticed that some of you were wearing cleats with leather that was starting to dry out and crack, which makes it weak and prone to tearing.

They offer better foot protection than last year’s model, and they are significantly lighter, which may help you run faster. In addition, for the next two weeks, we can special order any other cleats at a team discount—20 percent off the regular price. If the cleats we have in stock don’t work for you, we can purchase a pair that will. I don’t want to have to sideline you for wearing unsafe equipment to the match.

In two previous books, entitled ‘Yorkshire Coast and Moorland Scenes’ and ‘Yorkshire Dales and Fells,’ I have described the northern half of the great county, and in this third volume I have in a similar manner dealt with the southern parts.

Owing to the enormous area of the county and the treasures it contains, the task of selection has not been easy, and the work of exploring, notetaking, painting, and writing, has spread over some four years.

One weekend, we searched for fish at a sizeable lake with a guide whose boat had an underwater video camera. Just after we got in the boat, the guide drew our attention to a northern pike—swimming in the water near the end of the pier—that we could see with our bare eyes. Soon after we headed for deeper waters, we spotted a school of walleye, followed by a good-sized specimen of a fish called a burbot, located near a river inlet. After that, we headed back to shore and donned masks and wetsuits to explore the shoreline. I was thrilled to identify several fish as smallmouth bass, hiding in a shady, rock-lined cove. But the highlight of the day happened shortly before leaving when I saw a four-foot muskellunge fish, also known as a muskie, its dark body contrasting with the sandy lake bottom below.

Stopping midway of the road, Stephen Culpeper glanced back over the vague streets and the clearer distance, where the approaching dusk spun mauve and silver cobwebs of air. From that city, it seemed to him, a new and inscrutable force—the force of an idea—had risen within the last few months to engulf the Square and all that the Square had ever meant in his life. Though he was only twenty-six, he felt that he had watched the decay and dissolution of a hundred years. Nothing of the past remained untouched. Not the old buildings, not the old trees, not even the old memories.

3795.	The following excerpt is from A Midnight Fantasy by Thomas Bailey Aldrich (1873).

It was a tranquil June night, with no moon, but clusters of sensitive stars that seemed to shiver with cold as the wind swept by them; for perhaps there was a swift current of air up there in the zenith. However, not a leaf stirred on the Common; the foliage hung black and massive, as if cut in bronze; even the gaslights appeared to be infected by the prevailing calm, burning steadily behind their glass screens and turning the neighboring leaves into the tenderest emerald. Here and there, in the somber row of houses stretching along Beacon Street, an illuminated window gilded a few square feet of darkness; and now and then a footfall sounded on a distant pavement. The pulse of the city throbbed languidly.

The author describes the Common largely in terms of its

A.	trees.
B.	stillness.
C.	structures.
D.	temperature.

3796.	The following excerpt is from The Filigree Ball by Anna Katherine Green (1903).

Mr. Jeffrey was sitting with his back to the door when I entered, but turned as I spoke his name and held out his hand for the note I carried. I had no expectation of his remembering me as one of the men who had stood about that night in the Moore house, and I was not disappointed. To him I was merely a messenger, or common policeman; and he consequently paid me no attention, while I bestowed upon him the most concentrated scrutiny of my whole life. Till now I had seen him only in half lights, or under circumstances precluding my getting a very accurate idea of him as a man and a gentleman. Now he sat with the broad daylight on his face, and I had every opportunity for noting both his features and expression.

The passage suggests that Mr. Jeffrey is

A.	forgetful.
B.	secretive.
C.	dismissive.
D.	mistrustful.

Next, they installed childproof locks on the cabinet doors and drawers that were within easy reach of a small child. They then installed safety latches on their kitchen appliances, because toddlers can open oven, dishwasher, and refrigerator doors, too. Afterwards, they placed gates at the top and bottom of the staircase. Lastly, they put doorknob covers on their interior and exterior doors to keep their child from entering or exiting rooms without their supervision. With evening approaching and many items still on their to-do list, they decided to continue their project early the next morning.

Based on the passage, what did the couple do just before they placed gates at the top and bottom of the staircase?

A.	Put plastic plugs in their unused electrical outlets.
B.	Installed safety latches on their kitchen appliances.
C.	Put doorknob covers on their interior and exterior doors.
D.	Installed childproof locks on the cabinet doors and drawers.

3798.	Despite warmer outdoor temperatures during the summer, I still keep a light sweater or other wrap close at hand just in case a building’s air conditioning is set too low. During the hottest months of the year where I live, restaurants and movie theaters are kept too cold for my taste. But they aren’t the only culprits. I’ve noticed that doctors’ offices and indoor shopping malls tend to be chilly, and even my workplace is overcooled. Just the other day, I met friends at a favorite lunchtime restaurant, and all of the outdoor tables in the shade were taken. After we were seated inside, a stream of cold air was hitting me right on the back of my neck, so I just slipped on my trusty backup sweater. Over the course of my meal, I noticed that many of the other diners also had something draped around their shoulders to fend off the chill.

Which of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?

A.	A light sweater is a versatile piece of clothing.
B.	Some buildings are kept too cool during the summer.
C.	Business owners should pay more attention to customers.
D.	Dining outdoors can be more comfortable than dining inside.

3799.	When I was growing up, my parents always treated Sunday dinners as special occasions. By late afternoon we would put on some music and start the preparations. I usually made the salad. I’d spend at least 30 minutes lovingly preparing the ingredients—lettuce, carrots, celery, and tomatoes, usually. My mom would typically cook a roast or make lasagna, and my dad would prepare an elegant dessert. But the food, as appetizing as it was, made up only part of what was so enjoyable about those dinners. Our table was always open for friends and extended family. We lingered at the table, telling stories and laughing until it grew dark outside. Then we would clean up the kitchen and return to the table to play games.

Which of the following terms best characterizes the tone of the passage?

A.	jubilant
B.	nostalgic
C.	instructive
D.	lighthearted"
